INTRODUCTION

    Klingon is the official language of the Klingon Empire. For a
    long time, only a few non-Klingons were able to learn enough
    about the language to engage in a meaningful conversation
    with a Klingon. Recently, however, under the auspices of the
    Federation Scientific Research Council, a study has been
    undertaken to record and analyze the language and culture of
    the Klingons, with the ultimate goal of preparing an encyclo-
    pedia, as well as teaching materials. This dictionary repre-
    sents the initial results of that effort.

    The dictionary is divided into two main parts: grammatical
    sketch and dictionary proper.

    The grammatical sketch is intended to be an outline of
    Klingon grammar, not a complete description. Nevertheless,
    it should allow the reader to put Klingon words together in an
    acceptable manner. Many of the rules given in the grammati-
    cal sketch are those set down by Klingon grammarians. It
    should be remembered that even though the rules say "always" 
    and "never" when Klingon is actually spoken these
    rules are sometimes broken. What the rules represent, in
    other words, is what Klingon grammarians agree on as the "best" Klingon.

    Because research is not yet completed, this dictionary is of
    necessity somewhat limited in scope. There are certainly
    more Klingon words than those listed here. Three groups of 
    words in particular are, for the most part, unrepresented:
    scientific terminology; words for native tools, customs, flora,
    and fauna; and vocabulary dealing with food. Terms associated 
    with the various sciences are the subject of a special study,
    and a report is currently being prepared. Klingon words for
    traditional tools and long-standing customs are difficult to
    translate into English. Native plants and animals are likewise
    difficult to comprehend at the present time. Such matters will
    be fully elucidated in the forthcoming <Klingon Encyclopedia.>
    Food words are missing due to limited resources: there have
    been problems recruiting staff interested in studying Klingon
    eating habits. Until that study is under way, it was thought
    inappropriate to present a list of words whose meanings are
    not properly understood.

    As more data are gathered the list of words will undoubtedly grow. 
    Even at this early stage, however, some patterns are
    emerging. For example, there are no words for greetings,
    such as <hello, how are you, good morning,> and so on. It seems
    apparent that such words and phrases simply do not exist in
    Klingon. When two Klingons meet each other (except in cases
    where military protocol determines behavior), if anything of
    an introductory nature is said, it is an expression that can best
    be translated as <What do you want?> Unlike most speakers of
    English, who begin conversations with greetings, inquiries
    about the state of health of the conversants, and remarks
    about the weather, Klingons tend to begin conversations by
    Simply stating the main points.

    Although Klingons are proud of their language and frequently 
    engage in long discussions about its expressiveness
    and beauty, they have found it impractical for communication
    outside the Klingon Empire. For intra- and intergalactic
    communication, the Klingon government, along with most
    other governments, has accepted English as the lingua franca.
    In general, only those Klingons of the upper classes (which
    include higher-level governmental and military officials) learn
    English. As a result, English has taken on two additional
    functions in Klingon society. 

    First, it is used as a symbol of rank or status. 
    Those Klingons who know English will use it
    among themselves to show off their erudition and make their
    place in society known to all who happen to be listening.
    Second, English is used when it is thought best to keep[[p.11]]
    servants, soldiers, or even the general populace uninformed.
    Thus, on a Klingon vessel, the commanding officer will often
    speak Klingon when giving orders to his crew, but choose
    English when having discussions with his officers. On the
    other hand, a Klingon officer may use Klingon in the presence
    of non-Klingons to prevent them from knowing what is going
    on. This use of Klingon seems to be quite effective.

    There are a number of dialects of Klingon. Only one of the
    dialects, that of the current Klingon emperor, is represented
    in this dictionary. When a Klingon emperor is replaced, for
    whatever reason, it has historically been the case that the next
    emperor speaks a different dialect. As a result, the new
    emperor's dialect becomes the official dialect. Those Kling-
    ons who do not speak the official dialect are considered
    either stupid or subversive, and are usually forced to undertake
    tasks that speakers of the official dialect find distasteful. Most
    Klingons try to be fluent in several dialects.

    Some dialects differ only slightly from the dialect of this
    dictionary. Differences tend to be in vocabulary (the word for
    <forehead,> for example, is different in almost every dialect)
    and in the pronunciation of a few sounds. On the other hand,
    some dialects differ significantly from the current official
    dialect, so much so that speakers of these dialects have a great
    deal of difficulty communicating with current Klingon official-
    dom. The student of Klingon is warned to check into the
    political situation of the Klingon Empire before trying to
    talk.

    There is a native writing system for Klingon (called {pIqaD})
    which seems to be well suited to the various dialects. This
    writing system is not yet well understood and is, therefore,
    not used in this dictionary. Instead, a transcription system
    based on the English alphabet has been devised. An article is
    being prepared for the <Klingon Encyclopedia> which will
    explain the details of {pIqaD.}

    In the grammatical sketch portion of this dictionary, as a
    notational convention, Klingon will be written in boldface
    type, and English translations will be written in italics:
    {tlhIngan} <Klingon.>
















1. THE SOUNDS OF KLINGON

    It is difficult to describe accurately the sounds of the Klingon
    language without using complex phonological and anatomical
    terminology. What follows, therefore, is intended to give only
    a guide to pronunciation. The best way to learn to pronounce
    Klingon with no trace of a Terran or other accent is to become
    friends with a group of Klingons and spend a great deal of
    time socializing with them. Very few non-Klingons speak
    Klingon without an accent.

    The system of writing Klingon used in this dictionary has
    been developed so people who already know how to read
    English will have a minimum of difficulty approximating the
    sounds of Klingon words and sentences.



1.1. Consonants


    {b} As in English <bronchitis> or <gazebo.> Some Klingons
        pronounce this sound as if it were {m} and {b} articulated almost
        Simultaneously. Speakers of English can approximate
        this sound by saying <imbalance> without the initial <i> sound.
        A very small number of Klingons pronounce {b} as if it were {m. }


    {ch} As in English <chew> or <artichoke.>


    {D} This sound is close to English <d> in <dream> or <android,> but
        it is not quite the same. The English <d> sound is made by[[p.14]]
        touching the tip of the tongue to that part of the roof of the
        mouth just behind the upper teeth. Klingon {D} can best be
        approximated by English-speakers by touching the tip of the
        tongue to the roof of the mouth at a point about halfway
        between the teeth and the velum (or soft palate), that part of
        the roof of the mouth that is rather gooshy. As with Klingon
        {b,} some speakers pronounce {D} as if it were more like <nd,> and
        a distinct minority as if it were {n}---but, of course, with the
        tongue in the same position as for {D.}


    {gh} This is not like anything in English. It can be produced
        by putting the tongue in the same position it would be in to
        say English <g> as in <gobble,> but relaxing the tongue somewhat
        and humming. It is the same as Klingon {H} (see below), but
        with the vocal cords vibrating at the same time.


    {H} This is also not like anything in English, but it is just like
        <ch> in the name of the German composer <Bach> or in the
        Yiddish tQaSt <l'chaim,> or the <j> in the Mexican city of <Tijuana>
        in <Baja California.> It is produced in the same way as Klingon


    {gh,} but is articulated with a very coarse, strong rasp. Unlike
        Klingon {gh,} the vocal cords do not vibrate in saying Klingon


    {H. }
        {j} As in English <junk;> never ever as in French <jour.>
        {l} As in English <lunge> or <alchemy.>
        {m} As in English <mud> or <pneumatic.> Those few Klingons
            who pronounce {b} as {m} would say Klingon {baH} <fire (a torpedo) >
            and {maH} <we> the same way, and have to memorize which word
            is spelled which way.


    {n} As in English <nectarine> or <sunspot.> Those Klingons who
        pronounce {D} more like {n} can easily articulate and hear the
        two sounds differently. Even a {D} that sounds like {n} is
        pronounced with the tongue in the Klingon {D} position, not in
        the English <d> position. Klingon {n} is produced with the tongue
        in the same position as English <d.>


    {ng} As in English <furlong;> never as in English <engulf.> The <g>
        is never pronounced as a separate sound. This sound never
        occurs at the beginning of an English word, but it does come
        at the beginning of a number of Klingon words. English-[[keep hyphen] ]
        speakers may practice making this sound at the beginning of a
        word by saying English <dang it!,> then saying it again without
        the <da.>


    {p} As in English <parallax> or <opprobrium.> It is always[[p.15]]
        articulated with a strong puff or pop, never laxly. Speakers of
        English may want to exercise care to avoid discharging saliva
        while articulating this sound. It should be noted, however,
        that Klingons do not worry about this.


    {q} Similar to English <k> in <kumguat,> but not quite that. The
        tongue position for English <k> is like that for Klingon {gh} and
        {H.} To produce Klingon {q,} the main body of the tongue
        touches the roof of the mouth at a point farther back than it
        does for {gh} or {H.} Indeed, the tongue reaches for or touches
        the uvula (the meshy blob that dangles down from the back of
        the roof of the mouth), so articulating {gq} approximates the
        sound of choking. The sound is usually accompanied by a
        Slight puff of air. English speakers are reminded that Klingon
        {gq} is never pronounced <kw> as in the beginning of English
        <quagmire.>


    {Q} This is like nothing particularly noteworthy in English.
        It is an overdone Klingon {q.} It is identical to {gq} except that it is
        very guttural and raspy and strongly articulated, somewhat
        like a blend of Klingon {gq} and {H.}


    {r} This is not like the <r> in American English, but it does
        resemble the <r> in some dialects of British English, as well as
        the <r> in many languages of Europe. It is lightly trilled or
        rolled.


    {S} This sound is halfway between English <s> and <sh,> as in
        <syringe> and <shuttlecock.> It is made with the tip of the tongue
        reaching toward that part of the roof of the mouth which it
        touches to produce Klingon {D. }


    {t} As in English <tarpaulin> or <critigque.> It differs from Kling-
        on {D} in two ways: (1) like {p,} it is accompanied by a puff of air;
        and (2) the tongue touches a position on the roof of the
        mouth farther forward than that for {D. }

    {tlh} This sound does not occur in English, but it is very
        much like the final sound in <tetl,> the Aztec word for <egg,> if
        properly pronounced. To produce this sound, the tip of the
        tongue touches the same part of the roof of the mouth it
        touches for {t,} the sides of the tongue are lowered away from
        the side upper teeth, and air is forced through the space on
        both sides between tongue and teeth. The sound is produced
        with a great deal of friction, and the warning given in the
        description of Klingon {p} might be aptly repeated here.


    {v} As in English vulgar or demonstrative.


    {w} Usually as in English <worrywart> or <cow.> On rare occassion, 
        especially if the speaker is being rather deliberate, it is
        pronounced strongly, more like {Hw} or even {Huw. }


    {y} As in English <yodel> or <joy.>


    {'} The apostrophe indicates a sound which is frequently
        uttered, but not written, in English. It is a glottal stop, the
        slight catch in the throat between the two syllables of <uh-oh> or
        <unh-unh,> meaning "no." When Klingon {'} comes at the end of
        a word, the vowel preceding the {'} is often repeated in a very
        soft whisper, as if an echo. Thus, Klingon {je'} <feed> almost
        sounds like {je'e,} where the articulation of the first {e} is
        abruptly cut off by the {',} and the second {e} is a barely audible
        whisper. When {'} follows {w} or {y} at the end of a word, there is
        often a whispered, echoed {u} or {I,} respectively. Occasionally
        the echo is quite audible, with a guttural sound like {gh}
        preceding the echoed vowel. For example, {yIlI'} <transmit it!> 
        can sound more like {yIlI'ghI.} This extra-heavy echo is
        heard most often when the speaker is particularly excited or
        angry.




1.2. Vowels

    There are five vowels in Klingon.

    {a} As in English <psalm;> never as in American English <crabapple.>

    {e} As in English <sensor.>

    {I} As English <i> in <misfit.> Once in a while, it is pronounced
        like <i> in <zucchini,> but this is very rare and it is not yet known
        exactly what circumstances account for it,

    {o} As in English <mosaic.>

    {u} As in English <gnu> or <prune;> never as in <but> or <cute.>


    NOTE that when a vowel is followed by {w} or {y,} the
    combination of letters may not represent the same sound it
    does in English spelling:

    KLINGON RHYMES WITH ENGLisH AS IN

    {aw } <Ow> < cow >
    {ay} <y> < cry >
    {ey} <ay> < pay >
    {Ly } <ey> < key >
    {oy} <oy> < toy >

    Klingon {uy} resembles <ooey> in English <gooey.> Klingon {ew}
    resembles nothing in English, but can be approximated by
    running Klingon {e} and {u} together. Likewise, Klingon {Iw} is {TI}
    and {u} run together. No words in Klingon have {ow} or {uw.} If
    they did, they would be indistinguishable from words ending
    in {o} and {u,} respectively.



1.3. Stress

    Each Klingon word of more than one syllable normally
    contains one stressed (or accented) syllable. The stressed
    syllable is pronounced at a slightly higher pitch and with a
    little more force than the nonstressed syllable(s).

    In a verb, the stressed syllable is usually the verb itself, as
    opposed to any prefix or suffix. If, however, a suffix ending
    with {'} is separated from the verb by at least one other suffix,
    both the verb and the suffix ending in {'} are stressed. In
    addition, if the meaning of any particular suffix is to be
    emphasized, the stress may shift to that syllable. Suffixes
    indicating negation or emphasis (section 4.3) are frequently
    stressed, as is the interrogative suffix (section 4.2.9).

    In a noun, the stressed syllable is usually the syllable right
    before the first noun suffix, or the final syllable if there is no
    suffix. If, however, a syllable ending in {'} is present, it is
    usually stressed instead. If there are two syllables ina row
    {'} both ending in {',} both are equally stressed.

    Finally, it should be noted that there are some words which
    seem to have variable stress patterns, with the stress some-
    times heard on one syllable and sometimes on another. This
    phenomenon is not yet understood. The rules given above do
    not account for this variability, but if they are followed, stress
    will wind up on acceptable syllables.

    In the system used to transcribe Klingon in this dictionary,
    stress is not indicated. 

















2. GRAMMATICAL SKETCH 

    It is not possible, in a brief guide such as this, to describe the
    grammar of Klingon completely. What follows is only a
    sketch or outline of Klingon grammar. Although a good many
    of the fine points are not covered, the sketch will allow the
    student of Klingon to figure out what a Klingon is saying and
    to respond in an intelligible, though somewhat brutish,
    manner. Most Klingons will never know the difference.

    There are three basic parts of speech in Klingon: 
        <noun,>
        <verb,> and 
        <everything else>



3. NOUNS

    There are various types of nouns in Klingon.

    3.1. Simple nouns

        Simple nouns, like simple nouns in English, are simple words;
        for example, {DoS} <target> or {QIH} <destruction.>

    3.2. Complex nouns

        Complex nouns, on the other hand, are made up of more than one part.

    3.2.1. Compound nouns

        Compound nouns consist of two or three nouns in a row,
        much like English <earthworm> (<earth> plus <worm>) or <password>
        (<pass> plus <word>). For example, {jolpa'} <transportroom> consists
        of {jol} <transport beam> plus {pa'} <room.>

    3.2.2. Verb plus -wI'

        A second type of complex noun consists of a verb followed by
        a suffix meaning one who does or thing which does. The
        English suffix <-er> (as in <builder> ©*’one who builds"' or <tQaSter>
        "thing which tQaSts") is a rough equivalent. In Klingon, the[[p.20]]
        suffix is {-wI'.} It occurs, for example, in {baHwI'} <gunner,> which
        consists of the verb {baH} <fire (a torpedo)> plus {-wI'} <one who
        does.> Thus, {baHwI'} is literally "‘one who fires [a torpedo]."
        Similarly, {So'wI'} <cloaking device> comes from the verb {So'}
        <cloak> plus {-wI'} <thing which does.> {So'wI'} is a "thing which
        Cloaks."

        A noun formed by adding {-wI'} to a verb is a regular noun,
        so it may be used along with another noun to form a
        compound noun. For example, {tIjwI'ghom} <boarding party>
        comes from {tIjwI'} <boarder> plus {ghom} <group;> and {tIjwI'} comes
        from {tIj} <board> plus {-wI'.}

    3.2.3. Other complex nouns

        There are a good many nouns in Klingon which are two or,
        less frequently, three syllables long, but which are not
        complex nouns of the types described above. These nouns
        probably at one time were formed by combining simple
        nouns, but one or all of the nouns forming the complex noun
        are no longer in use, so it is not possible (without extensive
        etymological research) to know what the individual pieces
        mean.

        For example, {'ejDo'} means <starship.> The syllable {'ej} also
        occurs in {'ejyo'} <Starfleet.> There are, however, no known
        Klingon words {'ej, Do',} or {yo'} that have anything to do with
        Starfleet, starships, the Federation, or space vehicles of any
        kind. It is quite likely that {Do'} is an Old Klingon word for
        Space vessel (the modern Klingon word is {Duj}) that is used
        nowhere except in the noun {'ejDo'.} Of course, without
        further study, that remains pure conjecture.

    3.3. Suffixes

        All nouns, whether simple or complex, may be followed by
        one or more suffixes. If there are two or more suffixes, the
        suffixes must occur in a specific order. Suffixes may be
        classified on the basis of their relative order after the noun.
        There are five types of suffixes (which, for convenience, will
        be numbered 1 through 5). 
        
        Suffixes of Type 1 come right after the noun; 
        suffixes of Type 2 come after those of Type 1;
        suffixes of Type 5 come last. 
        
        This may be illustrated as follows: NOUN--1--2--3--4-—-5

        Of course, if no suffix of Type 1 is used but a suffix of Type 2 is used, 
        the Type 2 suffix comes right after the noun. 
        If a suffix of Type 5 is the only suffix used, it comes right after the noun.

        Only when two or more suffixes are used does their order become apparent.
        There are at least two suffixes in each suffix type. 
        Only one suffix of each type may be used at a time. 

        That is, a noun cannot be followed by, for example, two or three Type 4 suffixes.

        The members of each suffix type are as follows.

    3.3.1. Type 1: Augmentative/diminutive

        {-'a'} augmentative

                This suffix indicates that what the noun refers to is bigger,
                more important, or more powerful than it would be without the suffix.

            {SuS} <wind, breeze> {SuS'a'}   <strong wind>
            {Qagh} <mistake> {Qagh'a'}      <major blunder>
            {woQ} <power> {woQ'a'}          <ultimate power>

        {-Hom} diminutive

                This is the opposite of the augmentative suffix. It indicates
                that what the noun refers to is smaller, less important, or less
                powerful than it would be without the suffix.

            {SuS} <wind, breeze> {SuSHom}   <wisp of air>
            {roj} <peace> {rojHom}          <truce, temporary peace>


    3.3.2. Type 2: Number

        As in English, a singular noun in Klingon has no specific suffix
        indicating that it is singular: {nuH} <weapon> refers to a single
        weapon of any type. Unlike English, however, the lack of a
        specific suffix for plural does not always indicate that the noun
        is Singular. In Klingon, a noun without a plural suffix may still
        refer to more than one entity The. plurality is indicated by a 
        pronoun, whether a verb prefix (see section 4.1) or a full word
        (section 5.1), or by context. For example, {yaS} officer may
        refer to a single officer or to a group of officers, depending on
        other words in the sentence or the context of the discussion.

        Compare:

        {yaS vimojpu'} <I became an officer.>
        {yaS DImojpu'} <We became officers.>
        {yaS jIH} <I am an officer.>
        {yaS maH} <We are officers.>

        In the first pair of sentences, the only difference is the verb
        prefix (here only partially described; see section 4.1): {vI-} <I,>
        {DI-} <we.> In the second pair, the pronouns are different: {jIH} <I,>
        {maH} <we.>

        Under certain circumstances, the only way to know whether the noun 
        refers to one or more than one entity is by
        context. Thus, {yaS mojpu'} can be translated either <he/she
        became an officer> or <they became officers.> Those taking part in
        any discussion in which this sentence is used would presumably already 
        know whom is being talked about, so they would
        also know whether he or she or they is the correct meaning.
        Fortunately for students of Klingon, it is never incorrect to
        add a plural suffix to a noun referring to more than one entity,
        even in those cases where it is unnecessary to do so. Accord-
        ingly, both {yaS maH} and {yaSpu' maH} are correct, both
        meaning <we are officers> ({-pu'} is a plural suffix). On the other
        hand, a plural suffix cannot be added to a noun referring to
        only one thing, even if pronouns are present in the sentence.
        In Klingon, {yaSpu' jIH} <I am officers> is aS incorrect as its
        English translation.


        There are three different plural suffixes in Klingon.

        {-pu'} <plural for beings capable of using language>
                This suffix can be used to indicate plurality for Klingons,
                Terrans, Romulans, Vulcans, and so on, but not for lower
                animals of any kind, plants, inanimate objects, electromag-
                netic or other beams or waves, etc.

        {yaS} <officer> {yaSpu'} <officers>

        {Duy} <emissary> {Duypu'} <emissaries>

        {-Du'} <plural for body parts>
            This suffix is used when referring to body parts of those
            beings capable of using language as well as of any other animal.

        {gam} <foot> {gamDu'} <feet>

        {tlhon} <nostril> {tlhonDu'} <nostrils>

        {-mey} <plural, general usSage> This suffix is used to mark the plural of any noun.

        {mID} <colony> {mIDmey} <colonies>

        {yuQ} <planet> {yuQmey} <planets>

        It can also be used with nouns referring to beings capable of
        using language (those nouns which take {-pu'}). When it is so
        used, it adds a notion of "scattered all about" to the meaning.

        Compare:
            {puq} <child>
            {puqpu'} <children>
            {puqmey} <children all over the place>

        The suffix {-mey} cannot be used with body parts. It should
        be noted, however, that Klingon poets often violate this
        grammatical rule in order to evoke particular moods in their
        poetry. Thus, forms such as {tlhonmey} <nostrils scattered all
        about> do occur. Until the subtle nuances of such constructions
        are firmly grasped, however, it is suggested that students of
        Klingon stick to the rules.

        Finally, some nouns in Klingon are inherently or always
        plural in meaning, and therefore never take plural suffixes.

        {ray'} <targets> 
        {cha} <torpedoes>
        {chuyDaH} <thrusters>

        The singular counterparts of such words are utterly distinct:

        {DoS} <target>
        {peng} <torpedo>
        {vIj} <thruster>

        The singular forms may take the {-mey} suffix, but the
        meaning always carries the "scattered all about" connotation:

        {DoSmey} <targets scattered all about>
        {pengmey} <torpedoes all over the place>

        Inherently plural nouns are treated grammatically as singu-
        lar nouns in that singular pronouns are used to refer to them
        (sections 4.1, 5.1). For example, in the sentence {cha yIghuS}
        <Stand by torpedoes!> or <Get the torpedoes ready to be fired!> the
        verb prefix {yI-,} an imperative prefix used for singular objects,
        must be used even though the object ({cha} <torpedoes>) has a
        plural meaning.


    3.3.3. Type 3: Qualification

        Suffixes of this type indicate the speaker's attitude toward the
        noun, or how sure the speaker is that the noun is being used
        appropriately.

        {-qogq} <so-called>

        This suffix indicates that the noun is being used ina false or
        ironic fashion. Saying {rojqoq} <so-called peace,> rather than
        Simply {roj} <peace,> indicates that the speaker does not really
        believe that peace is legitimate or likely to endure.

        {-Hey} <apparent>

        This suffix indicates that the speaker is pretty sure the
        object referred to by the noun is accurately described by the
        noun, but has some doubts. For example, if the scanner on a
        Klingon ship senses an object, and the officer reporting the
        presence of this object assumes, but is not yet sure, that the
        object is a vessel, he will probably refer to the object as
        {DujHey} <an apparent vessel,> rather than simply {Duj} <vessel.>

        {-na'} <definite>

        This is the counterpart of {-Hey.} It indicates that there is no
        doubt in the speaker's mind as to the accuracy of his or her
        choice of words. Once the Klingon officer referred to above is
        Sure that the object the scanner has found is a vessel, he might
        report the presence of {Dujna'} <a definite vessel, undoubtedly a vessel.>


    3.3.4. Type 4: Possession/specification

        Type 4 is the largest class of noun suffixes. It consists of all the
        possessive suffixes, plus suffixes which can be translated as
        English <this> and <that.>

        The possessive suffixes are:

        {-wIj} <my> {-maj} <our>

        {-lIj} <your> {-raj} <your (plural)>

        {-Daj} <his, her, its> {-chaj} <their>

        Thus, {juH} <home> occurs in {juHwlj} <my home,> {juHlIj} <your
        home,> {juHchaj} <their home,> etc.

        When the noun being possessed refers to a being capable of
        using language, a special set of suffixes is used for first- and
        second-person possessors:

        {-wI'} <my> {-ma'} <our>

        {-lI'} <your> {-ra'} <your (plural)>

        These suffixes occur in, for example, {joHwI'} <my lord> and
        {puqlI'} <your child.> It is grammatically correct to use the
        regular possessive suffixes with nouns referring to beings
        capable of speech (as in {puqlIj'} <your child>), but such con-
        structions are considered derogatory; {joHwIj} for <my lord>
        borders on the taboo. Students of Klingon should bear this
        in mind.

        To indicate that one noun is the possessor of another noun
        (e.g., <enemy's weapon>), no suffix is used. Instead, the two
        nouns are said in the order possessor-possessed: {jagh nuH}
        <enemy's weapon> (literally, <enemy weapon>). This construction
        is also used for phrases translated by <of the> in English, such as
        <weapon of the enemy.> (See also section 3.4.)

        There are two suffixes indicating how close to the speaker
        the object referred to by the noun is.

        {-vam} <this>

        Like its English translation, this suffix indicates that the
        noun refers to an object which is nearby or which is the topic
        of the conversation.

        {nuHvam} <this weapon (near me as I speak) >

        {yuQvam} <this planet (that we've been talking about)>

        When used with a plural noun (one with a plural suffix or an
        inherently plural noun), {-vam} is translated <these.>

        {nuHmeyvam} <these weapons>

        {-vetlh} <that>

        This suffix indicates that the noun refers to an object which
        is not nearby or which is being brought up again as the topic
        of conversation.

        {nuHvetlh} <that weapon (over there)>

        {yuQvetlh} <that planet (as opposed to the one we were just talking about)>

        When used with a plural noun, {-vetlh} is translated <those:> {nuHmeyvetlh} <those weapons>

        There is no Klingon equivalent for English <a, an, the.> In
        translating from Klingon to English, one must use context as
        a guide to when to use <a> or <an> and when <the.> In this book, <a> or
        <an> and <the> are used in translations to make the English sound
        more natural.


    3.3.5. Type 5: Syntactic markers

        These suffixes indicate something about the function of the
        noun in the sentence. As in English, subjects and objects are
        normally indicated by the position of the noun or nouns in
        the sentence. The following two English sentences have the
        same words, but the sentences have different meanings due to
        the order of the words:

        <Dogs chase cats.>
        <Cats chase dogs.>

        Subjects and objects in Klingon are likewise indicated by
        word order. This is described in section 6.1.
        In other instances, English indicates the function of nouns
        in a sentence by adding words, particularly prepositions. In
        the following English sentence, the word <around> before
        <canaries> indicates that the canaries are neither chasing nor
        being chased:

        <Dogs chase cats around canaries.>

        Similarly, in Klingon, nouns which indicate something
        other than subject or object usually must have some special
        indication of exactly what their function is. Unlike English,
        this is accomplished by using suffixes.

        {-Daq} <locative>

        This suffix indicates that something is happening (or has
        happened or will happen) in the vicinity of the noun to which
        it is attached. It is normally translated by an English preposi-
        tion: <to, in, at, on.> The exact translation is determined by the
        meaning of the whole sentence. For example, {pa'Daq} is {pa'}
        <room> plus the suffix {-Daq.} It may occur in sentences such as
        the following:

        {pa'Daq jIHtaH} <I'm in the room.>
        {pa'Daq yIjaH} <Go to the room.>

        In the first sentence, {jIH} <I> is used in the sense of <I am> (see
        section 6.3), so <in> is the most reasonable translation of {-Daq. }
        In the second sentence, the verb is {jaH} <go,> so <to> makes the
        most sense as a translation of {-Daqq.} 
        
        An English preposition need not be part of the translation. 
        Klingon {Dung} means <area above,> and {DungDaq} is <overhead,> literally something like "at
        the area above." For further discussion on prepositional concepts, see section 3.4.

        It is worth noting at this point that the concepts expressed
        by the English adverbs <here, there,> and <everywhere> are
        expressed by nouns in Klingon: {naDev} <hereabouts,> {pa'} <there-abouts,> {Dat} <everywhere.> 
        These words may perhaps be translated more literally as "area around here," "’area over there,"
        and "all places," respectively. Unlike other nouns, these
        three words are never followed by the locative suffix. 
        that {pa'} <thereabouts> and {pa'} <room> are identical in sound;
        {pa'Daq,} however, can mean only <in/to the room.>)

        There are a few verbs whose meanings include locative
        notions, such as {ghoS} <approach, proceed.> The locative suffix
        need not be used on nouns which are the objects of such verbs.

        {Du} ghoStaH} <It is approaching the ship.>
            ({Duj} <ship, vessel,> {ghoStaH} <it is approaching it>)

        {yuQ wIghoStaH} <We are proceeding toward the planet.>
            ({yuQ} <planet,> {vIghoStaH} <we are proceeding toward it>)

        If the locative suffix is used with such verbs, the resulting
        sentence is somewhat redundant, but not out-and-out wrong.
        {DujJDaq ghoStaH} <It is approaching toward the ship.>

        {-vo'} <from>

        This suffix is similar to {-Daqq} but is used only when action is
        in a direction away from the noun suffixed with {-vo'.}
        {pa'vo' yIjaH} <Leave the room!>
        A more literal translation of this sentence might be "Go from the room."

        {-mo'} <due to, because of>

        This suffix occurs in sentences such as:
        {SuSmo' jogtaH} <It is fluttering in the breeze.>
        The noun {SuSmo'} means <due to the breeze,> so the whole
        sentence is literally "due to the breeze, it [a flag] is fluttering."

        {-vaD} <for, intended for>

        This suffix indicates that the noun to which it is attached is
        in some way the beneficiary of the action, the person or thing
        for whom or for which the activity occurs.
        {Qu'vaD lI' De'vam} <This information is useful for the mission.>

        The noun {Qu'vaD} means <for the mission,> and in this sentence
        {-vaD} indicates that the information is intended to be used
        somehow for the mission under discussion.

        {-'e'} <topic>

        This suffix emphasizes that the noun to which it is attached
        is the topic of the sentence. In English, this is frequently
        accomplished by stressing the noun (saying it emphatically) or
        by special syntactic constructions.

        {lujpu' jIH'e'} <I, and only I, have failed.> [[ lujpu' =>  jIlujpu' ]] <It is I who has failed.>

        {De"e! vItlhapnISpu'} <I needed to get the INFORMATION.>
        <It was the information (and not something else) that I needed.>

        Without the {'e',} these same sentences would have no noun[['e' => - 'e']] singled out for emphasis:

        {lujpu' jIH} <I have failed.> [[lujpu' =>  jIlujpu']]

        {De' vItlhapnISpu''} <I needed to get the information.>

        For a further use of {-'e',} see section 6.3.


    3.3.6. Relative ordering of the suffixes

        As briefly illustrated in the discussion of {-vam} <this> and {-vetlh}
        <that> (section 3.3.4), when a noun is followed by more than
        one suffix, the suffixes must occur in the proper order,
        according to the classification just described. It is rare for a
        noun to be followed by five suffixes, but it does happen from
        time to time. Some examples of nouns with two or more
        suffixes follow. (Suffix types are indicated by numbers.)

    
        {QaghHommeyHeylIjmo'} <due to your apparent minor errors>
            {Qagh}      (noun)      <error>
            {—Hom }     (1)         <diminutive>
            {-—mey }    (2)         <plural>
            {-Hey}      (3)         <apparent>
            {-lIj}      (4)         <your>
            {—mo ' }    (5)         <due to>


        {pa'wIjDaq} <in my quarters>
            {pa'} (noun) <room>
            {-wIj} (4)   <my>
            {-Daq} (5)   <locative>


        {Duypu'gogchaj} <their so-called emissaries>
        {Duy}    (noun)   <emissary>
        {-pu' }   (2)     <plural>
        {-qoq}    (3)     <so-called>
        {-chaj}   (4)     <their>


        {gamDu'wIjDaq} <at my feet>
        {qam}   (noun) <foot>
        {-Du" }  (2)   <plural>
        {-wIj }  (4)   <my>
        {-Daq }  (5)  <locative>

        {rojHom'e'} <the truce> (as topic)
        {roj} (noun) <peace>
        {—Hom } (1)  <diminutive>
        {—'e' } (5)  <topic>

        All examples of suffixes given so far show only simple
        nouns. Suffixes are attached to complex nouns (section 3.2) in
        exactly the same fashion.

        {DIvI'may'DujmeyDaq} <at/to the Federation battle cruisers>
        {DIvI'may'Duj} (noun) <Federation battlecruiser>
        {-—mey } (2) <plural>
        {-Daq  } (5) <locative>

        {baHwI'pu'vam} <these gunners>
        {baHwI' } (noun) <gunner>
        {-pu' }   (2)   <plural>
        {—vam }   (4)   <this>


    3.4. The noun-noun construction

        Some combinations of two (or more) nouns in a row are so
        common aS to have become everyday words. These are the
        compound nouns (as discussed in section 3.2.1). In addition,
        it is possible to combine nouns in the manner of a compound
        noun to produce a new construct even if it is not a legitimate
        compound noun (° legitimate" in the sense that it would be found in a dictionary).

        The translation of two nouns combined in this way, say 
        N1-N2 (that is, noun #1 followed by noun #2), would be <N2 of the N1.> 

        For example, {nuH} <weapon> and {pegh} <secret> combine to form {nuH pegh} <secret of the weapon.> 
        
        An alternate translation would be <N1's N2,> in this case, <the weapon's secret.> 
        As discussed in section 3.3.4, this is the Klingon possessive
        construction for a noun possessed by another noun.

        When the noun-noun construction is used, only the second
        noun can take syntactic suffixes (Type 5). Both nouns,
        however, may take suffixes of the other four types. For example:

        {nuHvam pegh} <secret of this weapon>
        {nuH } (noun)   <weapon>
        {—vam } (4)     <this>
        {pegh} (noun)   <secret>

        {jaghpu' yuQmeyDaq} <at/to the enemies' planets>
        {jagh}  (noun)  <enemy>
        {-pu' } (2)     <plural>
        {yuQ}   (noun)  <planet>
        {-—mey } (2)    <plural>
        {-Daq}  (5)     <locative>

        {puqwil' gamDu'} <my child's feet>
        {puq }  (noun)  <child>
        {—wI' } (4)     <my>
        {qam}   (noun)  <foot>
        {-Du}   (2)     <plural>

        English prepositional phrases are also rendered in Klingon
        by this noun-noun construction. Prepositional concepts such
        as above and below are actually nouns in Klingon, best
        translated as "area above," "area below," etc. The locative
        suffix (section 3.3.5) follows the second noun. For example:

        {nagh DungDaq} <above the rock>
        {nagh} (noun)   <rock>
        {Dung} (noun)   <area above>
        {-Daq} (5)      <locative>

        More literally, this is "at the area above the rock" or "at the rock's above-area."








4. VERBS

    Klingon verbs are mostly monosyllabic forms which may
    be accompanied by several affixes. As with Klingon
    nouns, Klingon verbs may take suffixes falling into a number
    of types based on their relative position following the verb.
    There are nine types of verb suffixes. Unlike Klingon
    nouns, Klingon verbs may take prefixes. Thus, if suffix types
    are indicated as numbers, the structure of a Klingon verb is:

    PREFIX--VERB-—1--—2--—3-—-4-—-5-—-6-—-7--8-—9


    4.1. Pronominal prefixes

        Each Klingon verb begins with a single prefix that indicates
        who or what is performing the action described by the verb
        and, when relevant, who or what is the recipient of that
        action. In other words, Klingon verb prefixes indicate both
        the subject and the object of the sentence.


    4.1.1. Basic prefixes

        The basic set of prefixes can be presented ina chart. (In order
        to make the chart as clear as possible, some prefixes are repeated.)

        Note that both the subject and the object are combined
        into a single prefix. 0 in the chart means that the particular
        Subject-object combinations are indicated by the absence of a
        prefix before the verb; -- in the chart notes subject-object
        combinations which cannot be expressed with the Klingon
        verb prefix system. For such meanings, suffixes (section 4.2.1)
        and/or pronouns (section 5.1) must be used.


                OBJECT      none    <me>    <you>   <him/her/it>      <us>    <you (plural)>   <them>
                SUBJECT
                  <I>     {jI-}   --      {qa-}      {vI-}         --        {Sa-}           {vI-}
                <you>     {bI-}   {cho-}   --         {Da-}         {ju-}     --              {Da-}
            <he/she/it>   0       {mu-}   {Du-}       0             {nu-}     {lI-}           0
                <we>      {ma-— }  ——     {pI-}       {wl-}         ——        {re-}           {DI-}
        <you (plural)>    {Su-}   {tu-}   ——          {bo-}         {che-}    -—-             {bo-}
                <they>    0       {mu-}   {nI-} {     lu-}          {nu-}     {lI-}           0



        The prefixes in the first column of the chart (headed "none") are used when there is no object; 
        that is, when the action of the verb affects only the subject (the "doer"'). 
        The verb {Qong} <sleep> occurs with the pronominal prefixes as follows:

        {jIQong}    <I sleep>
        {bIQong}    <you sleep>
        {Qong}      <he/she/it sleeps, they sleep>
        {maQong}    <we sleep>
        {SuQong}    <you (plural) sleep>

        In the case of {Qong} <he/she/it sleeps, they sleep,> the exact
        Subject would be indicated elsewhere in the sentence or by context.

        This set of prefixes is also used when an object is possible,
        but unknown or vague. Thus, {jIyaj} <I understand> can be used
        when the speaker understands things in general, knows what
        is going on, or understands what another speaker has just
        said. It cannot, however, be used for understanding a language or understanding a person. 
        Similarly, {maSop} <we eat> can be used to indicate a general act of eating, 
        but not if a specific food is mentioned.

        The remaining prefixes combine subject and object. Some
        of them are illustrated below, using the verb {legh} <see.>


        {qalegh}    <I see you>                         {cholegh}     <you see me>
        {vIlegh}    <I see him/her/it/them>             {mulegh}      <he/she/it sees me,> <they see me>
        {Salegh}    <I see you (plural)>                {tulegh}      <you (plural) see me>
        {Dalegh}    <you see him/her/it/them>           {Dulegh}      <he/she/it sees you>
        {julegh}    <you see us>                        {pIlegh}      <we see you>
        {legh}      <he/she/it sees him/her/it/them,>   {lulegh}      <they see him/her/it>
                    <they see them>



    4.1.2 Imperative prefixes [[4.1.2 =>  4.1.2.]]

        A special set of prefixes is used for imperatives, that is, verbs
        giving commands. Commands can be given only to <you> or <you (plural)>

        OBJECT              none    <me>    <him/her/it>    <us>    <them>
        <you>               {yI-}   {HI-}   {yI-}           {gho-}  {tI-}
        <you (plural)>      {pe-}   {HI-}   {yI-}           {gho-}  {tI-}



        Note that, with one exception, the identical prefix is used
        regardless of whether the command is being given to one or
        more than one person. The single exception is when a
        command is given but there is no object. In such cases, a
        special prefix {pe-} is used to give a command to several people.
        Examples of the imperative prefixes follow. 

        * Exclamation points in the translation indicate that it is a command. *

        {ylQong}    <sleep!>            {peQong}    <(you plural) sleep!>
        {HIqIp}     <hit me!>           {ghogIip}   <hit us!>
        {yIqIp}    <hit him/her/it!>    {tIqIp}     <hit them!>

        To indicate action directed against oneself in an imperative
        verb (e.g., <tell yourself>), the suffix {-egh} <oneself> is used along [[-egh => - 'egh ]]
        with {yI-} or {pe-} (see section 4.2.1).


    4.1.3 Notational conventions [[4.1.3 =>  4.1.3.]]

        As a notational convention, prefixes indicating subject and
        object will be translated as <subject--object> 
        e.g., 
            {qa-} <I--you,> 
            {pI-} <we--them.> 
        Imperative prefixes will be translated similarly,
        preceded by the word <imperative:> {tI-} <imperative: you--them.>

        Also, prefixes which can refer to male, female, inanimate,
        Singular, and/or plural (e.g., {vI-} <I--him/her/it/them>) will be
        translated correctly, but usually without giving all the options
        (e.g., <I--him/her>). This convention will also be used when
        translating verbs containing these prefixes; e.g., {vIlegh} <I see him/her.>


    4.2. Verb suffixes

        There are nine types of verb suffixes.

    4.2.1. Type 1: Oneself/one another

        {-egh} <oneself> [[-egh => -'egh ]]

        This suffix is used to indicate that the action described by
        the verb affects the performer of the action, the subject. It is
        translated by English <self.> When this suffix is used, the prefix
        set indicating "’no object" must also be used.

        {jIqip'egh}     <I hit myself>  ({qIp} <hit>)
        {biqIp'egh}     <you hit yourself>
        {qIip'egh}      <he/she hits himself/herself>

        It is also possible to use this suffix with imperative verbs.
        As with nonimperatives, the prefix indicating "no object" must be used.

        {yIja"egh}  <tell yourself!> ({ja'} <tell>)
        {peja"egh}  <tell yourselves!>
        {-chuq}     <one another>

        This suffix is used only with plural subjects. 
        It is translated <each other> or <one another.> 
        The prefix set indicating "no object" is also used when this suffix is used.

        {maqIpchuq}     <we hit each other>     ({qIp} <hit>)
        {SuqIpchuq}     <you (plural) hit each other>
        {qIpchuq}       <they hit each other>
        {peqIpchuq}     <hit each other!>


    4.2.2. Type 2: Volition/predisposition

        Suffixes of this type express how much choice the subject has
        about the action described or how predisposed the subject is
        to doing it.

        {-nIs} <need>

        {vIleghnIS}     <I need to see him/her>     ({legh} <see>)
        {bISopnIS}      <you need to eat>           ({Sop} <eat>)

        {-qang} <willing>

        {Heghqang}      <he/she is willing to die>     ({Hegh} <die>)
        {qaja'qang}     <I am willing to tell you>     ({ja'} <tell>)

        {-rup} <ready, prepared> (referring to beings)

        {Heghrup}       <he/she is ready to die>        ({Hegh} <die>)
        {qaleghrup}     <I am ready to see you>         ({legh} <see>)
        {nuja'rup}      <they are prepared to tell us>  ({ja'} <tell>)

        {-beH} <ready, set up> (referring to devices)

        {pojbeH}    <(the device) is set up to analyze it>      ({poj} <analyze>)
        {labbeH}    <(the device) is ready to transmit data>    ({lab} <transmit data>)


        There is, it should be noted, a verb {ghuS} which means 
        <to be prepared to launch or project (something).> 
        This verb never takes the suffix {-rup.} 
        It is used primarily in reference to torpedoes, 
        so much so that if the object is not specifically
        stated, and context does not dictate otherwise, it is always
        assumed to be <torpedoes.> Accordingly, both of the following
        sentences mean <Be prepared to launch torpedoes!> or <Stand by on torpedoes!>

        {cha yIghuS} ({cha} <torpedoes>)
        {yIghus}

        The verb {ghuS} can also be used in reference to, among
        other things, rockets, missiles, and various kinds of energy
        beams (which, like torpedoes, go from one point to another).
        It is also used to describe the action of pulling back the elastic
        band of a slingshot. In most other instances of preparedness,
        however, {-rup} is required.

        {-vIp} <afraid>

        {choHoHvIp}     <you are afraid to kill me>     ({HoH} <kill>)
        {muqIpvIp}      <they are afraid to hit us>     ({qIp} <hit>)

        This suffix is rarely used with a prefix meaning <I> or <we.>
        Though it is grammatically correct, it is culturally taboo.


    4.2.3. Type 3: Change

        Suffixes of this type indicate that the action described by the
        verb involves a change of some kind from the state of affairs
        that existed before the action took place.

        {-choH} <change in state, change in direction>

        {maDo'choH}     <we are becoming lucky, we are undergoing a turn of luck>   ({Do'} <be lucky>)

        {ghoSchoH} <he/she is beginning to go (somewhere) >
        ({ghoS} <go>)

        The implication of the second example is that he or she was
        going either nowhere or somewhere else sometime before the
        phrase was uttered. Note that the translation of this suffix
        may be English <become> or <begin to>

        {-qa'} <resume>

        Using this suffix implies that an action had been taking
        place, then it stopped, and then it began again.

        {vInejqa'} <I am resuming the search, I am searching for him/her again>    ({nej} <search>)


    4.2.4. Type 4: Cause

        {-moH} <cause>

        Adding this suffix to a verb indicates that the subject is
        causing a change of condition or causing a new condition to
        come into existence.

        {tIjwI'ghom vIchenmoH}  <I form a boarding party>
        ({tIljwI'ghom}          <boarding party,>
        {chen}                  <take form, take shape>)

        This sentence might also be translated <I cause a boarding party to be formed.>

        {HIQoymoH}  <let me hear (Something)>   ({Qoy} <hear>)

        More revealingly, this sentence could be translated <cause me
        to hear (something) .> Note that this sentence would not be
        used in asking permission to hear; it is a direct command.

        Normally, the best English translation of a verb with {-moH}
        does not contain the word <cause.> For example, {chenmoH}
        <he/she makes, creates> could be translated <he/she causes to take
        shape> ({chen} <take form, take shape>), but this is an awkward
        English phrase.


    4.2.5. Type 5: Indefinite subject/ability

        The two suffixes of Type 5 have nothing much to do with each
        other except for both being Type 5. As a result, no verb
        occurs with both of these suffixes at the same time.
        {-lu'} <indefinite subject>

        This suffix is used to indicate that the subject is unknown,
        indefinite, and/or general. Since the subject is always the
        same (that is, it is always unstated), the pronominal prefixes
        (section 4.1.1) are used ina different way. 
        
        Those prefixes which normally indicate first- or second-person subject and 
        third-person singular object ({vI-, Da-, wI-, bo-}) are used to
        indicate first- or second-person object. 
        
        Thus, {vI-,} which normally means <I do something to him/her,> 
        when in a verb with {-lu'} means  <someone/something does something to me.>
        Similarly, the prefix {lu-,} which normally means <they do something to him/her> 
        becomes <someone/something does something to them.>

        {Daqawlu'}  <someone/something remembers you>       ({gqaw} <remember>)
        {wIleghlu'} <someone/something sees us>             ({legh} <see>)
        {Soplu'}    <someone/something eats it>             ({Sop} <eat>)

        Verbs with {-lu'} are often translated into the English passive voice.

        {Daqawlu'}     <you are remembered>
        {wIleghlu'}     <we are seen>
        {Soplu'}        <it is eaten>

        When used with the verb {tu'}  <find, observe> and a third- [[keep hyphen] 
        person singular subject pronoun (0), the resulting verb form
        {tu'lu'} <someone/something finds it> is often translated by English <there is.>

        {naDev puqpu' tu'lu'}   <there are children around here, someone/something finds children here> 
        ({naDev}                <hereabouts,>       {puqpu' }
        <children>)

        {-laH} <can, able>

        {jIQonglaH}     <I can sleep>               ({Qong} <sleep>)
        {choleghlaH}    <you can see me>            ({legh} <see>)
        {nuQaw'laH}     <he/she can destroy us>     ({Qaw'} <destroy>)


    4.2.6. Type 6: Qualification

        Type 3 noun suffixes, these suffixes show how sure the
        speaker is about what is being said.

        {-chu'}     <clearly, perfectly>

        {jIyajchu'}     <I understand clearly>                      ({yaj} <understand>)
        {baHchu'}       <he/she fired (the torpedo) perfectly>      ({baH} <fire [a torpedo ] >)

        {-bej} <certainly, undoubtedly>

        {chImbej}   <it is undoubtedly empty>               ({chIm} <be empty>)
        {nuSeHbej}  <he/she is certainly controlling us>    ({SeH} <control>)

        {-law'} <seemingly, apparently>

        {chIimlaw'}     <it appears to be empty>                ({chIm} <be empty>)
        {nuSeHlaw'}     <he/she seems to be controlling us>     ({SeH} <control>)

        This suffix expresses any uncertainty on the speaker's part
        and may even be thought of as meaning <I think> or <I suspect.>
        Thus, the previous two sentences could be translated 
        <I think it's empty, I suspect that he/she is controlling us.>


    4.2.7. Type 7: Aspect

        Klingon does not express tenses (past, present, future). These
        ideas come across from context or other words in the sentence
        (such as {wa'leS} <tomorrow>). The language does, however,
        indicate aspect: whether an action is completed or not yet
        completed, and whether an action is a Single event ora
        continuing one.

        The absence of a Type 7 suffix usually means that the action
        is not completed and is not continuous (that is, it is not one of
        the things indicated by the Type 7 suffixes). Verbs with no
        Type 7 suffix are translated by the English simple present tense.

        {Dalegh}    <you see him/her>       ({legh} <see>)
        {qaja'}     <I tell you>            ({ja'} <tell>)

        When the context is appropriate, verbs without a Type 7
        suffix may be translated by the English future tense (<will>), but
        the real feeling of the Klingon is closer to English sentences
        such as <We fly tomorrow at dawn,> where the present-tense
        verb refers to an event in the future.

        {-pu'} <perfective>

        This suffix indicates that an action is completed. It is often
        translated by the English present perfect (<have done some- thing>).

        {Daleghpu'}     <you have seen it>      ({legh} <see>)
        {vIneHpu'}      <I wanted them>         ({neH} <want>)
        {qaja'pu'}      <I told you>            ({ja'} <tell>)

        {-ta'} <accomplished, done>

        This suffix is similar to {-pu',} but it is used when an activity
        was deliberately undertaken, the implication being that some-
        one set out to do something and in fact did it. English
        translations seldom reveal the distinction.

        {vISuqta'}  <I have acquired it>            ({Suq} <get, acquire>)
        {luHoHta'}  <they have killed him/her>      ({HoH} <kill>)

        The second sentence above could not be used if the killing
        were the result of a general attack not intended to killa
        specific person or if the killing were an accident. In such
        cases, {-pu'} would be used:

        {luHoHpu'} <they have killed him/her>

        The meaning of {-ta'} can also be indicated syntactically.
        That is, instead of using the suffix {-ta',} a special verbal
        construction can follow the verb which indicates the accomplished action. 
        This special verb is {rIn} <be finished, accomplished,> 
        and in this usage it always takes the suffix {-taH}
        <continuous> (see below) and the third-person pronominal
        prefix (0). 

        The resulting construction, {rIntaH,} literally means
        <it continues to be finished> or <it remains accomplished.> It is
        used to indicate that the action denoted by the preceding verb
        is a fait accompli: it is done, and it cannot be undone.

        {luHoH rIntaH}      <they have killed him/her>      ({HoH} <kill>)
        {vIje' riIntaH}     <I have purchased it>           ({je'} <purchase>)

        The English translations of {riIntaH} and {-ta'} are usually the same. 
        The notion of absolute finality implied by {rIntaH} seldom comes across.
        It should be noted that {riIntaH} is sometimes used for 
        dramatic effect, even in cases when the action could be undone.

        {-taH} <continuous>

        This suffix indicates that an action is ongoing.

        {nuqhoStaH}     <it is approaching us>      ({ghoS} <approach>)
        {yIghoStaH}     <steady on course!, maintain this course!>
        ({ghoS}         <go, approach, proceed on a course>)

        Both of the above sentences suggest a continuing activity.
        The meaning of {-taH} can be seen clearly by comparing the
        following two commands:

        {yIjun} <execute an evasive maneuver!>
        {yIjuntaH} <take evasive action!>

        In the first case, the maneuver is to be executed once only. In
        the second, a series of evasive maneuvers is to be executed, 
        the action is to be continuous.

        {-lI'} <in progress>

        This suffix is similar to {-taH} <continuous> in that it indicates
        that an activity is ongoing. Unlike {-taH,} however, {-lI'} implies
        that the activity has a known goal or a definite stopping point.
        In other words, it suggests that progress is being made toward that goal.

        {chollI'}   <it is getting closer>
        ({chol}     <get close, come near>)

        This word would be used for, i.e., a missile approaching a
        target, when it is known that the missile has been aimed at
        that target. If a missile is getting closer, but its intended
        destination is not known, {choltaH} (with {-taH} <continuous>)
        would be more appropriate.

        {vIlI'lI'}  <I am transmitting (the data)>
        ({lI'}      <transmit data to a place>)

        This word implies that data are in the process of being
        transmitted, but that there is a finite amount of data, so there
        will be a definite end to the transmission. The fact that the
        verb {lI'} and the suffix {-lI'} are identical in sound is purely
        coincidental, so far as can be determined. 

        The suffix {-taH} <continuous> can be used whether there is a
        know goal or not. {-lI',} on the other hand, can be used only
        when there is an implied goal. It is possible to consider {-lI'} a
        <continuous> counterpart of {-ta',} and {-taH} a <continuous> coun-
        terpart of {-pu'.}


    4.2.8. Type 8: Honorific

        {-neS} <honorific>

        There is but one suffix in this category. It is used to express
        extreme politeness or deference. It is used only in addressing
        a superior, someone of higher rank in the Klingon social,
        political, or military hierarchy. It is never required.

        {qaleghneS}     <I am honored to see you>           ({legh} <see>)
        {HIja'neS}      <do me the honor of telling me>     ({ja'} <tell>)

        This suffix is used rather infrequently by Klingons.


    4.2.9. Type 9: Syntactic markers

        Similar to Type 5 noun suffixes (section 3.3.5), these verb
        suffixes have to do with the verb's role in the sentence. The
        first six suffixes will be noted briefly here, but illustrated more
        completely in section 6.2.

        {-DI'}      <as soon as, when>
        {DaSeHDI'}  <as soon as you control if>     ({SeH} <control>)
        {qara'DI'}  <as soon as I command you>      ({ra'} <command>)

        {-chugh} <if>
        {DaneHchugh}    <if you want them>      ({neH} <want>)
        {choja'chugh}   <if you tell me>        ({ja'} <tell>)

        {-pa'} <before>
        {choja'pa'}     <before you tell me>    ({ja'} <tell>)
        {qara'pa'}      <before I command you>  ({ra'} <command>)

        {-vis} <while>  This suffix is always used along with the Type 7 suffix

        {-taH} <continuous.>
        {SutlhtaHvis}   <while they are negotiating>    ({Sutlh} <negotiate>)
        {bIQongtaHvis}  <while you are sleeping>        ({Qong} <sleep>)

        {-bogh} <which>   This is the relative-clause marker. It is described in section 6.2.3.

        {-meH} <for>    This marks purpose clauses. See section 6.2.4.
        
        {-'a'} <interrogative>
                This suffix indicates that the sentence is a yes/no question;
                that is, a question which can be answered "‘yes" or "no." (See also section 6.4.).

        {cholegh'a'}    <do you see me?>            ({legh} <see>)
        {yaj'a'}        <does he/she understand?>   ({yaj} <understand>)

        Questions of other types require special question words (section 6.4).

        {-wI'} <one who does, thing which does>     This is the suffix described earlier (section 3.2.2) which turns verbs into nouns.
        {So'wI'} <cloaking device>  ({So'} <cloak, hide>)
        {baHwI'} <gunner>           ({baH} <fire [a torpedo]>)
        {joqwI'} <flag>             ({jogq} <flutter, wave>)


    4.2.10. Relative ordering of the suffixes

        As with nouns, when more than one suffix is used with a verb,
        they must occur in the correct order, according to their type.
        No more than one suffix of each type may occur at a time. No
        instances have been found of a verb followed by nine suffixes,
        but it is theoretically possible. A few examples should suffice
        to show ordering of the suffixes.

        {nuHotlhpu"a'}      <have they scanned us?>
        {nu-}   (prefix)    <they--us>
        {Hotlh} (verb)      <scan>
        {-pu' } (7)         <perfective>
        {-'a}   (9)         <interrogative>

        {Qaw"eghpu'}    <he/she destroyed himself/herself>
        0       (prefix)    <he/she>
        {Qaw'}  (verb)      <destroy>
        {-'egh} (1)         <oneself>
        {—pu' } (7)         <perfective>

        {wIchenmoHlaH}  <we can create it>
        {wI-}        (prefix)    <we--it>
        {chen }      (verb)      <take form>
        {—moH }      (4)         <cause>
        {-laH}       (5)         <can, able>

        {Daqawlu'taH} <you are to be remembered>
        {Da-} (prefix)  <you--him/her>
        {qaw} (verb)    <remember>
        {-lu' } (5)     <indefinite subject>
        {-taH} (7)      <continuous>

        {vItlhapnISpu'} <I needed to take him/her>
        {vI-} (prefix)  <I--him/her>
        {tlhap} (verb)  <take>
        {-nIS } (2)     <need>
        {-pu' } (7)     <perfective>

        {HeghqangmoHlu'pu'} <it made him/her willing to die>
        0 (prefix)      <he/she--him/her>
        {Hegh } (verb)  <die>
        {-qang } (2)    <willing>
        {—moH } (4)     <cause>
        {-lu' } (5)     <indefinite subject>
        {-pu' } (7)     <perfective>

        {maghoSchoHmoHneS'a'} <may we execute a course (to someplace) ?>
        {ma-— } (prefix)    <we>
        {ghos } (verb)      <proceed on a course>
        {-choH } (3)        <change>
        {—moH } (4)         <cause>
        {—neS } (8)         <honorific>
        {—'al} (9)          <interrogative>


    4.3. Rovers

        There is one additional set of verb suffixes which Klingon
        grammarians call {lengwI'mey} <rovers> (from {leng} <travel, roam,
        rove,> {-wI'} <thing which does,> {-mey} <plural>). Rovers are verb
        suffixes which do not have a fixed position in relation to the
        other suffixes following a verb but, instead, can come just
        about anywhere except following a Type 9 suffix. Their
        position is determined by the meaning intended. There are
        two types of rovers: the negative and the emphatic.

        {-be'} <not>
            This is the general suffix of negation, translated as English
            <not.> It follows the concept being negated.

        {vIlo'laHbe'}     <they are useless to me, I cannot use them>
        {v1I—-} (prefix)  <I--them>
        {lo'} (verb)     <use>
        {-laH} (5)      <can, able>
        {-be' } (rover) <not>
        {jISaHbe'}      <I don't care (which of several courses of action is followed) >

        {jI-} (prefix) <I>
        {SaH} (verb) <care, be concerned about>
        {—-be" } (rover) <not>

        {qay'be'} <it's not a problem, no problem (exclamation) >
        0 (prefix) <it>
        {qay' } (verb) <be a problem, be a hassle>
        {—-be" } (rover) <not>

        The roving nature of {-be'} is best illustrated in the following set of words.

        {choHoHviIp}        <you are afraid to kill me>
        {choHoHviIpbe'}     <you are not afraid to kill me>
        {choHoHbe'vIp}      <you are afraid to not kill me>
        {cho-} (prefix)     <you-—-me>
        {HOH } (verb)       <kill>
        {-vIp} (2)          <afraid>
        {—-be" } (rover)    <not>

        In the second word, the negated notion is <afraid> (that is, <not
        afraid>), and {-be'} follows {-vIp.} In the third word, the negated
        notion is <kill> (that is, <not kill>), so {-be'} follows {HoH.}[[p.47]]
        The suffix {-be'} cannot be used with imperative verbs. For
        imperatives, the following suffix is required.

        {-Qo'} <don't!, won't>      This negative suffix is used in imperatives and to denote refusal.
        {yIja'Qo'}          <don't tell him/her!>
        {yI-} (prefix)      <imperative: you-—-him/her>
        {ja'} (verb)        <tell>
        {-—Qo!' } (rover)   <don't!>

        {choja'Qo'chugh}    <if you won't tell me, if you refuse to tell me>
        {cho-} (prefix)     <you-—-me>
        {ja'} (verb)        <tell>
        {-—Qo" } (rover)    <won't>
        {-chugh} (9)        <if>

        {HIHoHvIpQo'}       <don't be afraid to kill me!>
        {HI-} (prefix)      <imperative: you--me>
        {HOH } (verb)       <kill>
        {-vIp} (2)          <afraid>
        {-—Qo!' } (rover)   <don't!>

        Unlike {-be',} the position of {-Qo'} does not change: it occurs
        last, unless followed by a Type 9 suffix. Nevertheless, it is
        considered a rover because it is the imperative counterpart to {-be'. }

        {-Ha'} <undo>
            This negative suffix implies not merely that something is
            not done (as does {-be'}), but that there is a change of state:
            something that was previously done is now undone. For
            convenience, it will here be translated as <undo,> but it is closer
            to the English prefixes <mis-, de-, dis-> (as in <misunderstand,
            demystify, disentangle>). It is also used if something is done
            wrongly. Unlike {-be', -Ha'} can be used in imperatives.

        {chenHa'moHlaH}     <it can destroy them>
        0 (prefix)          <it-—-them>
        {chen } (verb)      <take form>
        {—-Ha" } (rover)    <undo>
        {—moH } (4)         <cause>
        {-laH} (5)          <can, able>

        This verb actually means something like it can cause them to undo their form.

        {yIchu'Ha'}     <disengage it! (e.g., cloaking device) >
        {yI-} (prefix)  <imperative: you--it>
        {chu" } (verb)  <engage, activate>
        {—-Ha" } (rover) <undo>

        {bIjatlhHa'chugh}   <if you say the wrong thing>
        {bI-} (prefix)      <you>
        {jatlh} (verb)      <say>
        {—-Ha" } (rover)    <undo>
        {-chugh} (9)        <if>

        This shows how {-Ha'} can be used in the sense of <wrongly.> The
        word might be translated as <if you misspeak.> Using {-be'} (that
        is, {bIjatlhbe'chugh}) would mean <if you don't speak.>

        {Do'Ha'}        <it is unfortunate>
        0 (prefix)      <it>
        {-—Do" } (verb) <be lucky, fortunate>[[-Do'=Do'] ]
        {—-Ha" } (rover) <undo>

        The use of {-Ha'} in this sentence suggests a turn of luck from good to bad.

        It is interesting that {-Ha'} always occurs right after the verb.
        It is not known why Klingon grammarians insist on calling it a
        rover. It was felt best not to argue with Klingon tradition,
        however, so {-Ha'} is here classified as a rover.

        {-qu'} <emphatic>

        This suffix emphasizes or affirms whatever immediately precedes it.

        {yIHaghqu'}      <study him/her well>[ [Hagh =>  HaD]]
        {yI-} (prefix)  <imperative: you-—-him/her>
        {Hagh} (verb)   <study>[[Hagh=> HaD] |
        {-qu' } (rover) <emphatic>

        {nuQaw'qu'be!'}     <they have not finished us off>
        {nu-} (prefix)      <they-—-us>
        {Qaw'" } (verb)     <destroy>
        {-qu' } (rover)     <emphatic>
        {—-be" } (rover)    <not>

        The roving nature of {-qu'} can be seen in the following set:

        {pIHoHvipbe'qu'}    <we are NOT afraid to kill you>
        {pIHoHvipqu'be'}    <we are not AFRAID to kill you>
        {pIHoHqu'vIpbe'}    <we are not afraid to KILL you>
        {pI-} (prefix)      <we--you>
        {HOH } (verb)       <kill>
        {-vIp} (2)          <afraid>
        {-be' } (rover)     <not>
        {-qu' } (rover)     <emphatic>

        The first word above might be used after an enemy challenged the bravery of the speaker. 
        The second might be followed by an explanation such as, "We are not willing to kill
        you because we require your services." The third word would
        be used to emphasize killing, as opposed to some other form
        of punishment.

        The rover {-qu'} also follows verbs when they are used adjectivally (section 4.4).


    4.4 Adjectives [[4.4 =>  4.4.]]

        There are no adjectives as such in Klingon. Those notions
        expressed as adjectives in English (such as <big, tired>) are
        expressed by verbs in Klingon (<be big, be tired>). A verb
        expressing a state or quality can be used immediately follow-
        ing a noun to modify that noun.

        {puq Doy'}  <tired child>
        {puq}       <child>
        {Doy'}       <be tired>
        {Dujmey tIn} <big ships>
        {Dujmey}     <ships, vessels>
        {tIn}       <be big>

        The rover {-qu'} <emphatic> (section 4.3) may follow verbs
        functioning adjectivally. In this usage, it is usually translated <very.>

        {Dujmey tIngqu'}    <very big ships>[[p.50]]
        {wanlIl' ramgqu'}   <a very unimportant event>
        {wanl'}             <event, occurrence>
        {ram}               <be trivial, unimportant>

        If a Type 5 noun suffix is used (section 3.3.5), it follows the
        verb, which, when used to modify the noun in this way, can
        have no other suffix except the rover {-qu'} <emphatic.> The Type
        5 noun suffix follows {-qu'.}

        {veng tInDaq}       <in the big city>
        {veng}              <city>
        {tIn}               <be big>
        {-Daq}              <locative>
        {veng tIngu'Daq}    <in the very big city>


5. OTHER KINDS OF WORDS

    By far the bulk of Klingon words are nouns and verbs. There
    are a few others which, probably as an expedient, Klingon
    grammarians lump together in a group called {chuvmey}

    <leftovers.> It is possible to classify the {chuvmey} somewhat.

    5.1. Pronouns

        In addition to possessive suffixes for nouns (section 3.3.4) and
        pronominal prefixes for verbs (section 4.1), there is a set of
        nine pronouns which are independent words. [[nine =>  ten]]

        {jIH}    <I, me>            {maH}       <we, us>
        {SoH}   <you>               {tlhIH}     <you (plural)> [[SOH =>  SoH]]
        {ghaH}  <he/she, him/her>   {chaH}      <they, them>
        {"oH}   <it>                {bIH}       <they, them>
        {'e'}   <that>
        {net}   <that>

        The pronoun {chaH} <they> is used when it refers to a group of
        beings capable of using language; otherwise, {bIH} <they> is used.
        The pronouns {'e'} and {net} are used only in special sentence
        constructions (see section 6.2.5).

        There is no grammatical gender in Klingon. Third-person 
        Singular pronouns can be translated <he> or <she> as context dictates.

        Pronouns may be used as nouns, but only for emphasis or
        added clarity. They are not required. Thus, the following sets
        of sentences are all grammatically correct.

        {yaS villegh jIH}   <I see the officers.>
        {yas vilegh}
        {jIH mulegh yaS}    <The officer sees me.>
        {mulegh yas}
        {ghaH vIlegh jIH}   <I see him/her.>
        {ghaH viIlegh}
        {vIlegh jIH}
        {vIllegh }
        ({yaS}              <officer> 
        {vIlegh}            <I see him/her,> 
        {mulegh}            <he/she sees me> )

        The final two sentences ({vIlegh jIH, vIlegh}) are in fact
        ambiguous. They could equally well mean <I see them.> 
        (The verb prefix {vI-} is either <I--him/her> or <I--them.>) 
        If context does not make it clear which meaning is intended, pronouns can be used:

        {ghaH vIlegh}   <I see him/her.>
        {chaH vIlegh}   <I see them.>

        Pronouns are not used in possessive constructions in the
        way nouns are; instead, the set of possessive noun suffixes is used (section 3.3.4).

        Finally, pronouns can be used as verbs, in the sense of "'I am, " etc. (See section 6.3).



    5.2. Numbers

        The Klingon numbers are:

        1 {wa'} 
        2 {cha'} 
        3 {weJ} 
        4 {los}
        5 {vagh} 
        6 {jav}
        7 {Soch}
        8 {chorgh}
        9 {Hut }
        10 {wa'maH}

        Higher numbers are formed by adding special number-
        forming elements to the basic set of numbers (1--9). 
        Thus, {wa'maH} <ten> consists of {wa'} <one> plus the number <ten> {maH.} 
        Counting continues as follows:

        11 {wa'maH wa' } (that is, <ten and one>)
        12 {wa'maH cha'} (that is, <ten and two>)
        etc.

        Higher numbers are based on 
        {maH}               <ten,> 
        {vatlh}             <hundred,> and
        {SaD} or {SanID}    <thousand.> 


        20 {cha'maH}    (that is, <two tens>)
        30 {we jmaH}    (that is, <three tens>)
        etc.

        100 {wa'vatlh}  (that is, <one hundred>)
        200 {cha'vatlh} (that is, <two hundreds>)
        etc.

        1,000 {wa'SaD} or {wa'SanID}    (that is, <one thousand>)
        2,000 {cha'SaD} or {cha'SanID}  (that is, <two thousands>)
        etc.

        Numbers are combined as in English:
            5,347   {vaghSad wejvatlh loSmaH Soch}  {vaghSanID wejvatlh loSmaH Soch}
            604     {javvatlh loS}
            31      {wejmaH wa' }

        higher numbers are:
            ten thousand        {netlh}
            hundred thousand    {bIp}
            million             {'uy'}
            Zero is             {pagh }

        Numbers are used as nouns. AS such, they may stand alone
        as subjects or objects or they may modify another noun.

        {mulegh cha'}   <Two (of them) see me.>
        ({mulegh}       <they see me,> {cha'} <two>)
        {wa' yIHoH}    <Kill one (of them) !>
        ({wa'}          <one,> {yIHoH} <kill him/her!>)

        The preceding sentence is grammatically correct even without
        the {wa'} because the prefix {yI-} indicates a singular object. The
        {wa',} therefore, is used for emphasis only.

        Numbers used as modifiers precede the noun they modify.
        {loS puqpu'} or {loS puq}           <four children>
        {vaghmaH yuQmey} or {vaghmaH yuQ}   <fifty planets>
        The plural suffixes ({-pu', -mey}) are not necessary when a number is used.

        When a number is used for numbering, as opposed to counting, it follows the noun. Compare:
        {DuS wa'}   <torpedo tube number 1>
        {wa' DuS}   <one torpedo tube>

        Ordinal numbers (<first, second,> etc.) are formed by adding {-Dich} to the numbers.
        {wa'DIch}   <first>
        {cha'DIch}  <second>
        {HutDIch}   <ninth>

        Ordinal numbers follow the noun. {meb cha'DIch} <second guest>
        Adding {-logh} to a number gives the notion of repetitions.
        {wa'logh}   <once>
        {cha'logh}  <twice>
        {Hutlogh}   <nine times>

        These numbers function in the sentence as adverbials (section 5.4).


    5.3. Conjunctions

        Conjunctions are of two types: those that join nouns together
        and those that join sentences together. The meanings of the
        two types of conjunctions, however, are the same:

        JOINING NOUNS       JOINING SENTENCES
        {je}                {'ej}               <and>
        {joq}               {qoj}               <and/or>
        {ghap}              {pagh }             <either/or>

        The conjunctions joining nouns come after the final noun.
        {DeS 'uS je}    <an arm anda leg>
        {DeS 'uS jog}   <an arm or a leg or both>
        {DeS 'eS ghap}  <either an arm or a leg (but not both)>

        The noun conjunction {je} has an additional function: when it
        follows a verb, it means <also, too.>

        {qaleghpu' je}  <I also saw you, I saw you too>

        As in English, the meaning of such sentences is ambiguous:
        <I and others saw you>      or    <I Saw you and others.>     
        The exact meaning is determined by context.

        In addition to the three listed above, there is one other sentence conjunction:
        {'ach}  <but, nevertheless, however, even so>
        This word is sometimes shortened to {'a.}

        The conjunctions joining sentences occur between the
        sentences they join. For illustrations, see section 6.2.1.


    5.4. Adverbials

        These words usually come at the beginning of a sentence and
        describe the manner of the activity.

        {batlh}     <with honor, in an honored fashion>
        {bong}      <by accident, accidentally, not intentionally>
        {chaq}      <perhaps>
        {chIch}     <on purpose, purposely>
        {DaH}       <now>
        {Do'}       <with luck, luckily>
        {loQ}       <slightly, a little bit>
        {nom}       <fast, quickly>
        {not}       <never>
        {pay'}      <suddenly>
        {pIj}       <often>
        {QIt}       <slowIy>
        {reH}       <always>
        {rut}       <sometimes>
        {tugh}      <soon>
        {vaj}       <thus, in that case, so, accordingly, then>
        {wej}       <not yet>

        Examples:

        {bong yaS vIHoHpu'}     <I accidentally killed the officer.>
        ({yaS}                  <officer,> 
        {vIHoHpu'}              <I killed him/her>)

        {batlh Daqawlu'taH}     <You will be remembered with honor.>
        ({Daqawlu'taH}          <somebody continues to remember you>)

        {vaj Daleghpu'}         <Then you have seen it.>
        ({Daleghpu'}            <you have seen it>)
        {wej vIlegh}            <I don't see him/her yet>
        ({vIlegh}               <I see him/her>)
        
        One word fits somewhat awkwardly into this category: {neH} <only, merely, just>

        Unlike the other adverbials, it follows the verb which it
        modifies. The semantic effect is one of trivializing the action.

        {gqqama' viqIppu' neH}  <I merely hit the prisoner.>
        {qama'}                 <prisoner,> 
        {vIqIppu'}              <I hit him/her>)
        {Du} ylIQotlh neH}      <Just disable the ship!>
        {Duj}                   <ship, vessel,> 
        {yIQotlh}               <disable it!>


        The use of {neH} in the preceding sentence implies that the ship
        is to be disabled, but not damaged further.
        Also unlike the other adverbials, {neH} can follow a noun. In
        such cases, it means <only, alone.>

        {yaS neH}       <only the officer, the officer alone>
        {jonta' neH}    <only the engine>

        Adverbials sometimes occur alone, functioning more or
        less as exclamations (section 5.5). For example:

        {nom}   <Move fast! Move quickly!>
        {wej}   <Don't do it yet!>
        {tugh}  <Hurry up!>


    5.5 Exclamations [[5.5 => 5.5.]]

        These expressions stand as sentences in their own right.

        {ghobe'}                <No.> (response to a question)
        {Ha'}                   <Let's go! Come on!>
        {HIja'} or {HISlaH}     <Yes.> (response to a question)
        {lu'} or {lug}          <Yes. Okay. I will.>
        {maj}                   <Good.> (expressing satisfaction)
        {majQa'}                <Very good. Well done.>
        {nuqneH}                <What do you want?> (greeting)
        {pItlh}                 <Done!>
        {Oo'}                   <No. I won't. I refuse.>
        {SuH} or {Su'}          <Ready!>
        {toH}                   <Well! So!>
        {wejpuH}                <Charming.> (used only ironically)
        {'eH}                   <Ready!>

        {HIja'} and {HISlaH} <yes> seem to be used interchangeably.
        {SuH, Su',} and {'eH} all mean that the speaker is about to give
        a command. They are comparable to the "Ready!" at the
        beginning of a race: "Ready! Set! Go!" {SuH} and {Su',} but not
        {'eH, } can also be used to indicate that the speaker is ready to
        do something or that arrangements have been made for
        something to happen. Some speakers of Klingon pronounce
        {SuH} as if it were {SSS,} almost like the English expression for “be quiet": <shhh!>
        {pItlh} is used for <It's done! I've done it! I've finished! All done!> etc. 
        
        The expression {toH} is roughly equivalent to English <aha!>
        Also included in the category of exclamations are Klingon
        curses. Only three such curses have been noted to date.

        {Ol 'yaH}   <*?!#@>
        {ghuy'cha'} <*@S%>
        {Qu'vatlh}  <#*@!>

    5.6. Names and address

        Klingon names are frequently mispronounced by non-[[keep hypen] ]
        Klingons. Furthermore, when written in the writing systems
        of other languages, they usually end up with spellings which
        only suggest their true pronunciation. For example, the
        Klingon sound {tlh} at the beginning of a word is almost always
        written <kl> by English speakers, presumably because the sound
        <tl> cannot occur at the beginning of an English word. Similarly,
        Klingon {Q} is often rendered <kr,> and Klingon {gq} always comes
        out <k.>

        The following is a list of a few Klingon names along with their usual English spellings.

        {mara }     <Mara>
        {matlh}     <Maltz>
        {qeng}      <Kang>
        {qeylis}    <Kahless>
        {qolotlh}   <Koloth>
        {qor}       <Kor>
        {qoreQ}     <Korax>
        {QaS }      <Kras>
        {Qel }      <Krell>
        {Qugh}      <Kruge>
        {torgh}     <Torg>
        {valQIS}   <Valkris>

        Names may be used in direct address (that is, calling
        somebody by name) at the beginning or end of the sentence.
        Other words in direct address (such as {qaH} <sir,> {joHwI'} <my
        lord>) are used similarly.

        {torgh HIghoS}  <Torg, come here!> ({HIghoS} <proceed toward me!>)
        {lu' qah}       <Yes, sir!>


6. SYNTAX

    As in any language, Klingon sentences range from the very
    Simple and straightforward to the very complex and convoluted. 
    What follows here are the mere basics of Klingon
    sentence structure. This information should provide a good
    foundation so that students of Klingon can converse properly,
    though not eloguently, while learning more about the language.

    6.1. Basic sentences

        The basic structure of a Klingon sentence is:

            OBJECT-—-VERB--SUBJECT

        This the reverse of the order in English, so care should be
        taken to avoid interpreting sentences backward. The subject
        is the person or thing doing the action described by the verb;
        The object is the recipient of that action.
        The importance of word order can be seen by comparing the following sentences.

        {puq legh yaS}  <The officer sees the child.>
        {yaS legh puq}  <The child sees the officer.>
            In both sentences, the words are identical: 
            {puq}   <child,> 
            {legh}  <he/she sees him/her,> 
            {yaS}   <officer.> 
            
        The only way to know who is seeing whom is by the order of the words in the sentence. 
        The verb {legh} is preceded by the prefix 0 <he/she--him/her.>
        When the subject and/or object is first or second person,
        the prefix on the verb must be the proper one.

            {puq villegh jIH}   <I see the child.>
            ({vIlegh}           <I see him/her>)
            {jIH mulegh puq}    <The child sees me.>
            ({mulegh}           <he/she sees me>)

        Actually, the first- and second-person pronouns are seldom
        used in sentences of this type (though they can, as here, be
        used for emphasis), so the following sentences illustrate more
        commonly occurring sentence types.

            {puq villegh}   <I see the child.>
            {mulegh puq}    <The child sees me.>

        Imperative sentences (commands) follow the same rules.

            {So'wI' yIchu'}     <Engage the cloaking device!>
            ({So'wI'}           <cloaking device,>
            {yIchu'}            <engage it!>)
            {DoS ylIbuS}        <Concentrate on the target!>
            {DoS}               <target,> 
            {yIbuS}             <concentrate on it!>
            {yaSpu' tIHoH}      <Kill the officers!>
            {yaSpu'}            <officers,> 
            {tIHoH}             <kill them!>

        Any noun in the sentence indicating something other than
        subject or object comes first, before the object noun. Such
        nouns usually end ina Type 5 noun suffix (section 3.3.5).
    
        {pa'Daq yaS vileghpu'}          <I saw the officer in the room.>
        {pa'Daq}                        <in the room, >
        {yaS}                           <officer,> 
        {vIleghpu'}                     <I saw him/her>)

        Other examples of this construction are given in section 3.3.5.


    6.2. Complex sentences

        A few of the more common types of more elaborate Klingon
        sentences will be illustrated.

    6.2.1. Compound sentences

        Two sentences may be joined together to form a longer
        compound sentence. Both sentences must be able to stand
        alone as properly formed sentences. When combined, they
        Simply come one after the other, joined by a conjunction (see section 5.3).

        {jISoptaH 'ej QongtaH}          <I am eating, and he/she is sleeping.>
        {jISoptaH 'ach QongtaH}         <I am eating, but he/she is sleeping.>
        {bISoptaH goj bItlhutlhtaH}     <You are eating and/or you are drinking.>
        {bISoptaH pagh biItlhutlhtaH}   <You are either eating or else you are drinking.>

        When the subject of both of the joined sentences is
        the same, the English translation may be reduced to a less
        choppy form, but Klingon does not allow this shortening.
        The pronominal prefix must be used with both verbs.
        Thus, the final two sentences above may be translated
            <You are eating and/or drinking; You are either eating or drinking.>

        When a noun (as opposed to simply a verbal prefix)
        indicates subject and/or object, there are some options in
        Klingon. In its fullest form, a Klingon sentence repeats the noun:

        {yaS legh puq 'ej yaS gIp puq}
        ({yaS}      <officer,> 
        {puq}       <child,> 
        {legh}      <he/she sees him/her,> 
        {qIp}       <he/she hits him/her>

        <The child sees the officer and the child hits the officer.> 
        or
        <The child sees the officer and hits the officer.>
        or
        <The child sees and hits the officer.>

        It is possible, however, to use pronouns rather than nouns in
        the second of the joined sentences. 
        {yaS legh puq 'ej ghaH gIp ghaH}    ({ghaH} <he/she>)
        <The child sees the officer and he/she hits him/her.>
        or
        <The child sees the officer and hits him/her.>

        If the context is clear, even the pronoun may be left out.
        {yaS vIlegh 'ej vIgIp} ({vI-} <I--him/her>)
        <I see the officer and I hit him/her.>
        or
        <I see the officer and hit him/her.>
        or
        <I see and hit the officer.>


    6.2.2. Subordinate clauses

        Klingon verbs ending in Type 9 suffixes (other than {-'a'}
        <interrogative> and {-wI'} <one who does, one which does>) always
        occur in sentences with another verb. Hence, they are verbs
        in subordinate clauses.

        {cha yIbaH qara'DI'} 
        or 
        {qara'DI' cha yIbaH}   <Fire the torpedoes at my command!>

        The two parts of this sentence are 
        {cha yIbaH} <fire the torpedoes!> and {qara'DI'} <when I command you> 
        or <as soon as I command you.> 
    
        {-DI'} is a Type 9 suffix meaning <as soon as, when,> 
        so {tqara'DI'} must occur as part of a larger sentence.
    
        Note that the order of the two parts of the sentence is variable.
        A few further examples should make the use of subordinate clauses clear.
        
        {bIjatlhHa'chugh qaHoH} or {qaHoH blIjatlhHa'chugh} 
        <If you say the wrong thing, IT will kill you.>
        ({bIjatlhHa'chugh} 
        <if you misspeak,> {qaHoH} <I kill you>)
    
        Note that although the English translation uses the word <will,>
        there is no marker for future in Klingon. The unsuffixed verb
        {HoH} <kill> is neutral as to time: since the person being[[p.63]]
        addressed is being given a chance to speak, that person must
        still be alive. Thus, the killing must take place in the future.

        {SutlhtaHvis chaH DIHIvpu' } or {DIHIvpu' SutlhtaHvis chaH} 
                        <While they were negotiating we attacked them.>
        {SutlhtaHvis}  <while they are negotiating, >
        {chaH}          <they,> 
        {DIHIvpu' }     <we attacked them>
    
        The notion of <were negotiating,> rather than <are negotiating, >
        comes from the suffix {-pu'} <perfective> attached to the verb {HIv}
        <attack.> A translation such as <While they are negotiating we
        attacked them> makes little sense in English and misrepresents
        the meaning of the Klingon sentence.


    6.2.3. Relative clauses

        Relative clauses are translated into English as phrases begin-
        ning with <who, which, where,> and, most commonly, <that.> Like
        adjectives, they describe nouns: <the dog which is running, the
        cat that is sleeping, the child who is playing, the restaurant
        where we ate.> The noun modified by a relative clause is the
        head noun.

        In Klingon, the verb in the relative clause ends with the
        Type 9 suffix {-bogh,} which will, for convenience, be translated <which.>
        Whether the head noun follows or precedes the relative
        clause depends on its relationship to that clause. Compare the following:

        {qIppu'bogh yaS}        <officer who hit him/her>
        {yaS qIppu'bogh}        <officer whom he/she hit>
    
        In both phrases, the relative clause is {qIppu'bogh} 
        {qIp}   <hit,>
        {-pu'}  <perfective,> 
        {-bogh} <which>, and the head noun is 
        {yas}   <officer.> 
    
        In the first phrase, {yaS} is the subject of the verb {qIp}
        (the officer is doing the hitting), so it follows {qIppu'bogh,}  just as all subjects follow the verb. 
        In the second phrase, {yaS} is the object (the officer is getting hit), so it precedes {qlIppu'bogh, }
        just as all objects precede the verb.

        The whole construction (relative clause plus head noun), as
        a unit, is used in a sentence as a noun. Accordingly, this
        construction follows or precedes the verb of the sentence,
        depending on whether it is the subject or object.
        {qIippu'bogh yaS vilegh} <I see the officer who hit him/her.>
    
        The entire relative construction 
            {qIppu'bogh yaS} <officer who hit him/her> is the object of the verb {vIlegh} <I see him/her,> 
        so it precedes the verb.
            {mulegh qIppu'bogh yaS} <The officer who hit him/her sees me.>
        
        Here, {qIppu'bogh yaS} is the subject of the verb {mulegh} <he/she sees me,> so it follows the verb.
    
        This pattern is also followed when the head noun is the
        object of the verb in the relative clause, such as 
        {yaSqIippu'bogh}            <officer whom he/she hit.>
        {yaS qIppu'bogh vIlegh}     <I see the officer whom he/she hit.>
        {mulegh yaS gIppu'bogh}     <The officer whom he/she hit sees me.>

        In the English translation, the relative pronouns 
        (<that,which,> etc.) may often be omitted: 
        <I see the officer he/she hit, the officer he/she hit sees me.> 
        In Klingon, however, {-bogh} is mandatory.


    6.2.4. Purpose clauses

        If an action is being done in order to accomplish something,
        or for the purpose of accomplishing something, the verb
        describing what is to be accomplished ends with the Type 9
        suffix {-meH,} which may be translated <for, for the purpose of,
        in order to.> The purpose clause always precedes the noun or
        verb whose purpose it is describing.

        {ja'chuqmeH rojHom neH jaghla'} 
        <The enemy commander [[jaghla'=> jaghla']] wishes a truce (in order) to confer.>
        The phrase {ja'chugmeH rojHom}      <a truce (in order) to confer> 
        is the object of the verb {neH}     <he/she wants it;> 
        the subject is {jaghla'}            <enemy commander.> 
        The object is a noun {rojHom}       <truce>

        [[jaghla'=> jagh la']] preceded by the purpose clause {ja'chugqmeH} <for the purpose of conferring>  
        or <in order to confer.> 
        The verb is made up of 
        {ja'}       <tell,> 
        {-chug}     <each other;>   thus,   <confer> is <tell each other.>
        {jagh luHoHmeH jagh lunejtaH}       <They are searching for the enemy in order to kill him/her.>
    
        Here the purpose clause is 
            {jagh luHoHmeH}                             <in order for them to kill the enemy,> 
            which is made up of the object noun {jagh}  <enemy> 
            preceding the verb {luHoHmeH}               <in order for them to kill him/her> 
            {lu-}                                       <they--him/her,> 
            {HoH}                                       <kill,> 
            {-meH}                                      <for>. 
    
        It describes the purpose of the verb 
        {lunejtaH}          <they are searching for him/her> 
        {lu-}               <they--him/her,> 
        {nej}               <seek, search for,> 
        {-taH}              <continuous>. 
    
        Note that, just as in compound sentences, the object
        noun {jagh} <enemy> occurs before each verb for which it is the
        object. Thus, somewhat more literally, the sentence may be
        translated <In order to kill the enemy, they are searching for the enemy.>
        Furthermore, just aS in compound sentences, the second of
        two identical nouns may be replaced by a pronoun or, if the
        context, is clear, left out altogether.

        {jagh luHoHmeH ghaH lunejtaH}
        {jagh luHoHmeH lunejtaH}    <They are searching for the enemy in order to kill him/her.>


    6.2.5. Sentences as objects

        Klingon has two special pronouns, {'e'} and {net,} which refer to
        the previous sentence as a whole. They are used primarily,
        not exclusively, with verbs of thinking or observation
        (such as <know, see>). They are always treated as the object
        verb, and the verb always takes a prefix indicating
        a third-person singular object. What is a single sentence
        in English is often two sentences in Klingon. {net} is used
        only under special circumstances (see page 66), but {'e'} is
        common. Several examples should make the use of {'e'} clear. 


        {qama'pu' DIHoH ‘'e' luSov}    <They know we kill prisoners.>
        This sentence is actually two: 

        (1) {qama'pu' DIHoH}  <We kill prisoners> 
            {qama'pu'}          <prisoners,> 
            {DIHoH}             we <kill them> 
        (2) {'e'luSov}  <They know that> 
            {'e'}       <that,> 
            {luSov}     <they know it>. 
        
        The pronoun {'e'} refers to the previous sentence, <We kill prisoners.>


        {yaS qIppu' 'e' viIlegh}        <I saw him/her hit the officers.>
        The two sentences here are: 
        
        (1) {yaS gIppu'}        <He/she hit the officer;> 
        (2) {'e' vilegh}        <I see that> 
            {vIlegh}            <I see it>. 
        
        The construction might equally well be translated as <I saw that he/she hit the officer.> 
    
        Note that the verb in the second sentence, 
        {vIlegh} <I see it,>  is neutral as to time. 
        The past tense of the translation
        <(I saw...)> comes from the verb in the first sentence, 
        {qIppu'}    <he/she hit him/her> 
        {-pu'}      <perfective>). 
    
        In complex sentences of this type, the second verb never takes an aspect suffix (section 4.2.7).

        When the verb of the second sentence has a third-person
        subject (that is, the pronominal prefix is 0) but the intended
        meaning is <one> or <someone,> rather than <he, she, it,> or <they,>
        {net } is used instead of {'e'.}

        {qama'pu' DIHoH net Sov}     <One knows we kill prisoners.>
    
        As above, the first sentence here is 
            {qama'pu' DIHoH}    <We kill prisoners.> 
        The second sentence is 
            {net Sov}           <One knows that.>

        The full construction implies that it is common knowledge
        that the group to which the speaker belongs kills prisoners.

        {Qu'vaD lI' net tu'bej}     <One certainly finds it useful for the mission.>

        The first part of this example is {Qu'vaD llI'} <It is useful for the
        mission> ({Qu'vaD} <for the mission,> {lI'} <it is useful>). The second
        part is {net tu'bej} <One certainly finds that> or <One certainly
        observes that.> The full construction might also be translated
        <One will certainly observe that it is useful to the mission.> Note
        that although the word <will> makes a more flowing translation,
        there is nothing in the Klingon sentence indicating future
        tense.

        When the verb of the second sentence is {neH} <want,> neither[[p.67]]
        {'e'} nor {net} is used, but the construction is otherwise identical
        to that just described.

        {jIQong vIneh}         <I want to sleep.>
        ({jIQong}               <I sleep,> 
        {vIneH}                 <I want it>)
        {qalegh vIneH}          <I want to see you.>
        {qalegh}                <I see you,> {vIneH} <I want it>
        {Dalegh vIneH}          <I want you to see him/her.>
        {Dalegh}                <you see him/her,> 
        {vIneH}                 <I want it>

        {qama'pu' vIjonta' vIneh}           <I wanted to capture prisoners.>
        {tqama'pu' viIjonta'}               <I captured prisoners> 
        {qama'pu'}                          <prisoners,> 
        {vIjonta'}                          <I captured them>.
    
        Note once again that the aspect marker (in this case, {-ta'} <accomplished>) 
        goes with the first verb only; the second verb, {vIneh} <I want it,> 
        is neutral as to time. The past tense of
        the translation <(I wanted...)> comes from the aspect marker
        on the first verb.

        Similarly, with verbs of saying (<say, tell, ask,> etc.), {'e'} and
        {net} are not used. The two phrases simply follow one another,
        in either order.

        {qaja'pu' HIqaghQo' }
        or 
        {HIqaghQo' qaja'pu'}    <I told you not to interrupt me.>
    
        This is literally <I told you, "Don't interrupt me!"> 
        or <"Don't interrupt me" I told you> 
        {gqaja'pu'}     <I told you,> 
        {HIqaghQo'}     <don't interrupt me!>). 
        
        An aspect marker (here, {-pu'} <perfective>) may
        always be attached to the verb of saying, regardless of
        whether it is the first or second verb.

        Finally, the use of {rIntaH} to indicate that an action is
        accomplished (section 4.2.7) is another example of the two-verb (or two-sentence) construction.



    6.3. "To be"

        There is no verb corresponding to English <to be> in Klingon.
        On the other hand, all pronouns (section 5.1) can be used as
        verbs, in the sense of <I am, you are,> etc.

        {tlhIngan jIH}  <I am a Klingon.>
        {yaS SoH}       <You are an officer.>
        {puqpu' chaH}   <They are children.>

        The pronoun always follows the noun.

        Similarly, there is no verb corresponding to <to be> in the
        sense of "'to be at a place." Again, the pronouns are used,
        followed, where appropriate, by verbal suffixes.

        {pa'wIjDaq jIHtaH} <    I am in my quarters.>
        ({pa'wIjDaqq}           <in my room,> 
        {jIH}                   <I,>
        {-taH}                  <continuous>)

        In the above examples, the subjects are pronouns. If the
        subject is a noun, it follows the third-person pronoun ({ghaH}
        <he/she,> {'oH} <it,> {chaH} <they,> {bIH} <they>) and takes the {-'‘e'}
        <topic> suffix (see section 3.3.5).

        {puqpu' chaH qama'pu!' ‘'e'}    <The prisoners are children.> [[qama'pu''e' => qama'pu' Te!) ]

        {pa'DajDaq ghaHtaH la"e'}        <The commander is in his quarters.>

        These sentences might also be translated <As for the prisoners,
        they are children; As for the commander, he is in his quarters.>
 
 
 
    6.4. Questions
 
        There are two types of questions: those which may be
        answered "‘yes" or °*no," and those which require explanations as answers.

        Yes/no questions are formed with the Type 9 suffix {-'a'}
        added to the verb. Examples are given in section 4.2.9.

        Appropriate answers to yes/no questions are:

        {HIja'}     or  {HISlaH}    <yes>
        {ghobe'}                    <no>

        The other type of question contains a question word:
        
        {chay'}     <how?>
        {ghorgh}    <when?>
        {nuq}       <what?>
        {nuqDaq}    <where?>
        {qatlh}     <why?>
        {'ar}       <how many? how much?>
        {"'Tv}      <who?>

        For {'Iv} <who?> and {nuq} <what?> the question word fits into the
        sentence in the position that would be occupied by the
        answer. For example:

        {yaS legh 'Iv}  <Who sees the officer?>
        {'Iv legh yaS}  <Whom does the officer see?>
    
        In the first question, it is the subject which is being asked
        about, so {'Iv} <who?> goes in the subject position, following the
        verb {legh} <he/she sees him/her.> In the second case, the object is
        being questioned, so the question word goes in the object
        position, before the verb.

        Similarly with {nuq} <what?:>

        {Du} ghoStaH nuq}   <What is coming toward the ship?>
        {Duj}               <ship, vessel,> 
        {ghoStaH}           <it is proceeding toward it>)

        {nuq legh yaS}      <What does the officer see?>

        Both {'Iv} and {nuq} are treated as nouns as far as the
        pronominal prefixes are concerned. That is, they are consid-
        ered third person.

        {nuqhoStaH nuq}     <What is coming toward us?> 
        {nuqhoStaH}         <it is proceeding toward us>    
        {nuq Dalegh}        <What do you see?> 
        {Dalegh}            <you see it>

        The word for <where?,> {nuqqDaq,} is actually {nuq} <what?>
        followed by the suffix {-Daq} <locative> (see section 3.3.5). 
        As would any locative phrase (see section 6.1), it comes at the
        beginning of the sentence.

        {nuqDaqq So'taH yaS}    <Where is the officer hiding?>
        {So'taH}                <he/she is hiding>

        Three other question words likewise occur at the beginning of the sentence. 

        {ghorgh Haw'pu' yaS}        <When did the officer flee?>
        {Haw'pu'}                   <he/she has fled>
        {qatlh Haw'pu' yaS}         <Why did the officer flee?>
        {chay' Haw'pu' yaS}         <How did the officer flee?>



        {chay' jura'}   <What are your orders?>
        This is actually 
        {chay'}     <how?,> 
        {jura'}     <you command us;> thus,
        <How do you command us?>

        The question word {chay'}   <how?>  may be used as a one-word
        sentence meaning <How did this happen? What happened? What the---?>
        
        Finally, {'ar} <how many? how much?> follows the noun to
        which it refers. It can never follow a noun with a plural suffix
        ({-pu', -mey, -—Du';} see section 3.3.2).
        
        {Haw'pu' yaS 'ar}   <How many officers fled?>
        {Haw'pu'}           <they fled,> 
        {yaS}               <officer>
        
        {nIn 'ar wIghaj}    <How much fuel do we have?>
        ({nIn}              <fuel,> 
        {wIghaj}            we <have it>)


    6.5. Commands

        Commands are given with appropriate imperative prefixes.
        See sections 4.1.2, 4.3. 6.6. 

    6.5 Comparatives and superlatives

        The idea of something being more or greater than something
        else (comparative) is expressed by means of a construction
        which can be represented by the following formula:

        AQ {law'} B Q {puS}

        In this formula, A and B are the two things being compared
        and Q is the quality which is being measured. 

        The two Klingon words in the formula are 
        {law'} <be many> and {puS} <be few.> 
        Thus, it says 
        <A's Q is many, B's Q is few> or 
        <A has more Q than B has> 
        or <A is Q-er than B.>
        
        Any verb expressing a quality or condition may fit into the QO slot.
        {la' jaq law' yaS jag puS}      <The commander is bolder than the officer.>
        {la'}                           <commander,> 
        {jaq}                           <be bold,>
        {yas}                           <officer>
    
        To express the superlative, that something is the most or
        the greatest of all, the noun {Hoch} <all> is used in the B position:
        {la' jaq law' Hoch jag puS} <The commander is boldest of all.>
        
        In comparative and superlative constructions, the verb of
        quality ({jaq} <be bold> in the sentences above) must be said twice.



7. CLIPPED KLINGON

    The preceding grammatical sketch describes "proper"!
    Klingon, that is, Klingon as it is taught in Klingon schools or
    to non-Klingons. In actual day-to-day use, however, spoken
    Klingon may vary somewhat from its "proper" form, usually
    by leaving some elements out. This abbreviated form of
    speaking, called Clipped Klingon by Klingon grammarians, is
    heard quite frequently in military contexts where quick
    rather than eloquent communication is deemed a virtue.
    Probably for similar reasons, Clipped Klingon is used quite
    extensively in all walks of Klingon life.

    Some of the features of Clipped Klingon are described below.

    7.1. Commands

        In giving commands, the imperative prefix (section 4.1.2)
        may be left off, leaving the bare verb.

        Proper Klingon: {yIbaH}    <Fire (the torpedoes) !>
        Clipped Klingon: {baH}

        Proper Klingon: {wIy yIcha'}   <Show the tactical display!>
        Clipped Klingon: {wIy cha'}
        {wIy}                           <tactical display on monitor,> 
        {cha'}                          <show, project>
        
        Proper Klingon: {He chu' yIghoS}   <Follow a new course!>
        Clipped Klingon: {He chu! ghoS}
        {He}    <course,> 
        {chu'}  <be new,> 
        {ghoS}  <follow a course>

        When the object noun is critical, and what is to be done
        with that noun is obvious (or should be obvious) to the
        listener, that noun itself may serve as the command.

        Proper Klingon: {chuyDaH yIlaQ}     <Fire the thrusters!>
        Clipped Klingon: {chuyDaH}          <Thrusters!>
        {chuyDaH}                           <thrusters,> 
        {laQ}                               <fire, energize>

        Proper Klingon: {HaSta yIcha'}      <Show the visual display!>
        Clipped Klingon: {HaSta}            <Visual (display) !>
        {HaSta}                             <visual display on monitor,> 
        {cha'}                              <show, projyect>)

        Finally, other grammatical markers, particularly noun suffixes, may be left out of commands.

        Proper Klingon: {jolpa'Daq yIjaH}   <Go to the transport room!>
        Clipped Klingon: {jolpa' yIjaH}
        {jolpa'}                            <transport room,> 
        {-Daq}                              <locative,> 
        {jaH}                               <go>

        It is not common, when noun suffixes are chopped, for the
        imperative prefix on the verb to be dropped as well.



    7.2. Responses to commands, status reports

        Responses to commands and status reports are also prone to clipping.

        Proper Klingon: {So'wI' vIchu'ta'}          <I have engaged the cloaking device.>
        Proper Klingon: {So'wI' chu'lu'ta'}         <The cloaking device has been engaged.>
        Clipped Klingon: {So'wI' chu'ta'}           <Cloaking device engaged.>
        {So'wI'}                                    <cloaking device,> 
        {vIchu'ta'}                                <I have engaged it,>
        {chu'lu'ta'}                                <it has been engaged>

        In the preceding example, the clipped form can correspond
        to either a dropping of the prefix {vI-} <I--it> or the suffix {-lu'}
        <indefinite subject.>

        Proper Klingon: {jIyajchu'}         <I understand clearly.>
        Clipped Klingon: {yajchu'}          <Understood clearly.>
        {yaj}                               <understand,> 
        {-chu'}                             <clearly, perfectly>

        In this final example, the clipped form, lacking the pronominal prefix {jI-} <I,> 
        is a likely response to a question in clipped
        form, such as 
            {yaj'a'}        <Understood?> 
            compare Proper Klingon
            {boIyaj'a'}     <Do you understand?>.



    7.3. Duress, excitement

        When in a situation of great danger or when immediate action
        may be necessary, a Klingon is apt to drop pronominal
        prefixes. This clipped form is also common when a Klingon is
        excited for some reason.
        
        Proper Klingon: {qama'pu' vIjonta' vineH}   <I wanted to capture prisoners.>
        Clipped Klingon: {qama'pu' jonta' neH}      <Wanted prisoners!>
        ({qama'pu'}                                 <prisoners,> 
        {vIjonta'}                                  <I captured them,> 
        {vIneH}                                     <I want them>)

        In context, it would be clear that the speaker is the one
        doing the wanting (and capturing), even though the pronominal prefix {vI-} <I--them> is missing. 






DICTIONARY 

    INTRODUCTORY REMARKS

    This dictionary contains four parts: 
    (1) Klingon to English,
    (2) English to Klingon, 
    (3) list of apexes in Klingon alphabetical order, 
    (4) list of affixes in English alphabetical order.

    Klingon alphabetical order is as follows:

    { a, b, ch, D, e gh, H, I, j, l, m, n, ng, o, p, q, Q, r, S, t, tlh, u, v, w, y }

    Note that {ch, gh, ng,} and {tlh} are considered separate letters.
    Thus the syllable {no} would precede the syllable {nga} in the Klingon list.

    Each Klingon word is tagged as to type (noun, verb, etc.).
    This tag occurs at the end of the English translation. The
    abbreviations used to indicate word types are:

    adv     adverbial       (section 5.4)
    conj    conjunction     (section 5.3)
    excl    exclamation     (section 5.5)
    n       noun            (section 3)
    num     number          (section 5.2)
    pro     pronoun         (section 5.1)
    gues    question word   (section 6.4)
    V       verb            (section 4) 



    In looking through the dictionary, it will be noticed that
    there are a number of noun/verb pairs; that is, the same word
    is both a noun anda verb. Futhermore, there are some words
    which are identical in form (and nearly identical in meaning)
    to some suffixes 
        example, {laH} is a noun meaning            <accomplishment> 
        and     {-laH} is a verb suffix meaning     <can, able>).


    There are also a number of Klingon synonyms; that is two
    Klingon words with identical meanings 
        example, {joh, jaw} [[ joh=> joH ]] <lord,> 
                {chetvI', DuS}              <torpedo tube>. 
    
    Occasionally one member of such a synonym set can be analyzed. 
    Thus, 
    {baHwI'}  <gunner>  consists of the 
        verb    {baH}       <fire (a torpedo)> 
        suffix  {-wI"'}     <one who does something.> 
        
    The other word for <gunner,> {matha', } [[matha'=> matHa'" ]] remains impervious to analysis. 
    
    Sometimes one member of a set may be partially analyzed. 
        example, {jonta'} <engine> 
                 begins with {jon,} 
                 which is also found in {jonwI'} <engineer,> 
                 and ends with {ta',} 
                 which also occurs in {mIqta'} <machinery.> 
             
             The other members of these synonym sets, 
             {QuQ}  <engine> and 
             {Jjo'} <machinery,> 



    For ease of reference, English entries in the English-Klingon section of this 
    dictionary begin with the word that the
    user would most likely be looking for, even though this may at
    times be grammatically incorrect. This first word is, when
    appropriate, followed by the correct translation. 

    Similarly, when a Klingon word is translated into an
    English phrase      (e.g., <have a headache>), 
    the first word in the English entry is the key word in the phrase, 
    followed by the proper translation  (e.g., <headache, have a headache>).
