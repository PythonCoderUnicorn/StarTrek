Warbird Class Battlecruiser





















In the mid-2340s, Starfleet intelligence began to get “sniffs” of a new Romulan warship type in operation across the Neutral Zone. Although  
Starfleet had not made contact with the Empire in several decades by this 
point, there always existed a keen interest in what their neighbors across  
the no-mans-land were up to. Long range scans revealed grainy images of 
a vessel of massive proportions, at least twice the size of and Federation          
starship and with an unusual power signature that defied the analysis of the best minds at Starfleet Engineering. Numerous attempts to penetrate the  Star Empire for information about this new vessel failed, and for many years Starfleet counted itself lucky that the Romulans had chosen to isolate themselves from the rest of the Alpha Quadrant. It wasn’t until 2364 that  the starship Enterprise got a first detailed look at the new Romulan behemoth, and the news wasn’t good. 
In the years since, much has been learned about the Warbird-class of 
Romulan battlecriusers. It is now known that the early versions of the class were badly under gunned and underpowered and were barely a match for the line starships of the day. It wasn’t until a modernization program  
started in 2356 that the Warbird began to grow as a serious contender in  
the field of galactic brinkmanship. From the start however, the Warbird was a wonderland of technological innovation and seemingly limitless potential.   
At the heart of the new class is a forced quantum singularity powerplant  
that provides power to her primary systems. Although the output is on par 
with a traditional M/AM arrangement, the advantage comes from never      
having to refuel the vessel during its operational lifetime. Once the reactor  
is brought on line, it stays that way. The tradeoff comes at the expense of a slightly lower top speed and manpower intensive maintenance needs. 
Over the years, the Romulans have continually upgraded the class and        
regularly abandon old models as new ones come on line. Different engine, 
disruptor and torpedo weapons have produced nearly a dozen subtypes of  
the class with some, like the B type D’Deridex remaining in production while others, like the type E Peregrine have fallen out of favor. Losses during the Dominion and Raven conflicts have brought about an additional six variants of the Warbird hullform in the last decade with more expected to follow. 
Each new generation of Warbird improves upon the last in some degree or    another, and the Romulans have become masters at finding new ways to  
expand the capabilities of their most cherished warship design.  
To date, Starfleet has captured three Warbirds of various types, though   
only the type E Peregrine-class Pi’kaht was taken with its quantum 
singularity core intact and running. Although all three vessels have yielded an enormous wealth of data, Starfleet has as yet been unable to reverse engineer the powerplant or at least restart the cores of the two remaining vessels. 
Current speculation holds that the cores are produced at a 
dedicated facility and the ship is built around the massive engine in space. The type A Warbird entered service in 2337 and immediately entered  wide scale production. In retrospect, the class was grossly underpowered 
and poorly gunned and was a poor match for existing Federation or Klingon  vessels of the day. However, the Warbird did demonstrate an enormous   
leap forward in the Romulan’s construction capabilities and techniques and  was an ominous portent of things to come in the next few years.  
The type B D’deridex was the direct result of information gleaned about 
the capabilities of the new Federation Galaxy-class starships. She was 
built with a completely new tactical suite and greater speed in mind. The  
D’deridex was envisioned as a specific counter to that perceived threat,   
though at a massive cost. Despite extensive losses of the D’deridexs  
during the Dominion and Raven conflicts, the ships of this type are still  
considered to be prestige assignments.   
The type C Talon was developed alongside the more powerful D’deridex 
class as an easier to build alternative to the grossly expensive flagship.     
Her suite of older but reliable RPL-3 plasma weapons were chosen over  
the then new and rare RTA-S torpedoes along with the easier to produce 
RWW-I disruptor banks. The Talons have never been choice assignments 
and took enormous losses during the Dominion and Raven conflicts.     
The type D Sparrowhawk was an experiment in turning the class into an   
all plasma gun platform. Slightly weaker shields and a poor torpedo array  marred the otherwise great potential of the class, and only a few were built.  
The type E Peregrine built upon the lessons learned from the   
Sparrowhawk and sports an all disruptor tactical array capable of a 
withering rate of fire. Upgraded heavy shields and weapons made the type  
E more sluggish in her handling, but the class was a complete success   
otherwise. The Peregrines were also grossly expensive to build and   
maintain and construction ended in 2379. 
The type F Kamarak was the first serious attempt to improve on the  
D’deridex design and has been only a partial success. Upgraded structural  systems, torpedo capacity, and shields came at the cost of a small  
measure of maneuverability, disruptor rate of power and secondary power  
generation. Although the Kamarak is in all respects superior to the  
D’deridex, most in the fleet find the elder type to be a more balanced   
defensive platform. One place the Kamarak does excel in over the   
D’deridex however is exploration, and the class has done much to expand   
the borders of the Empire in the last decade. Although the fleet’s smaller science vessels are fine at what they do, only the Kamarak‘s possess the  larger ship borne sensor platforms and telescopes that were specifically  designed for the class.                       





The type G Leviathan is an upgrade of the existing type A Warbird to
more modern specifications. Modest changes to her weapons array and
shields were almost secondary to bringing her computer systems,
sensors and crew support facilities up to modern specifications. The 
Leviathan has since become the second most prolific type of Warbird
next to the D’deridex and serves as the backbone of their fleet.
The H type Bloodhawk was developed with the Leviathan as a
dedicated intelligence asset. Great care went into improving her
cloaking performance and increasing her uncloaked sensor return. Like  
the Peregrine, the Bloodhawk was a fine warship but was much more
difficult to field and was quickly pulled from production. Naturally, only
the most loyal crews are chosen for service aboard the Bloodhawks.
The I type Raptor was a spirited attempt to add a massive set of 
plasma torpedoes to the class at the expense of several other systems.
Her shields and disruptor systems are adequate for the job, but the class
was not all it was hoped it would be. Plans exist to refit the six remaining
vessels of the type as dedicated command and control ships, though this
has as yet failed to take place.
The J type Decius is the second attempt to upgrade the aging
D’deridex, and in this it has been more of a success than the Kamarak.
Great care was taken in improving her fields of fire and shield systems
while a 35% increase in structural integrity has built a greater degree of
resiliency into the hull. The end result was a vessel that had finally
outstripped the D’deridex as a front line combatant. However, both  
types are still in production with talk of upgrading the existing B type
D’deridexs to the J standard in the next ten years. If this plan comes to
pass, the Romulans will plan to do so at a rate of four units per year, just as they did with the Leviathans.
The K type Terex is a massively complex and over gunned upgrade of  
the Decius class and is currently the most powerful ship type in the  
Romulan inventory. However, the class has been slow to reach fleet
service due to its complicated construction process and manpower
intensive maintenance needs. In the Decius, the Romulans have finally 
managed to mount plasma and photon torpedoes in the same hull along
with the most advanced secondary systems available. Rumors persist
that the class may give way to an even more powerful L type Avatar
class in the next few years, though these rumors are unconfirmed. If
true, the Romulans may finally be poised to shift the balance of power in
their favor along the Neutral Zone.
Of the 80 A type Warbirds produced, none remain in active service.
Thirty were refit to type G specifications, 27 were destroyed, four are
reported missing, presumed destroyed, 7 were scrapped, two are in the
Imperial Naval Training Command, two have been sold to private
interests within the Empire, 1 is in reserve status and one, the Tomed,
was captured by the Federation on stardate 4/7510. 7 have been
captured by or defected to the Romulan Free States. The A type is no
longer in production and was discontinued in 2372.  
Of the 82 type B D’Deridex-class warbirds produced, 42 remain in
active service. 34 have been destroyed, 5 have been scrapped and 1 is  
listed as missing, presumed lost. The type B is still in production at a
rate of 2 new units per year. 
Of the 37 type C Talon-class warbirds built, 9 remain in active service.
25 have been destroyed and three were scrapped. This type of warbird
is no longer being produced. 
Of the 15 type D Sparrowhawk-class warbirds built, 7 remain in active
service. 5 have been destroyed, two are listed as lost, presumed  
destroyed and one has been captured by the Romulan Free States. The
Sparrowhawk is no longer in production and was discontinued in 2379.
Of the 19 E type Peregrine-class warbirds built, 8 remain in active
service. 8 have been destroyed, 1 is listed as missing, presumed lost,
one has been scrapped and one, the Pi’kaht was captured by Starfleet
on stardate 4/8002. The Peregrines are no longer in production and
were discontinued in 2379. 
Of the 20 F type Kamarak-class warbirds built, 15 remain in active 
service. Five have been destroyed. The F type warbird is still produced
at a rate of two new vessels per year.    
Of the 42 G type Leviathan-class warbirds placed in service, twelve
were built specifically as that class and 30 were refit from type A
Warbirds. 34 remain in active service while 6 have been destroyed, 1
was scrapped and Starfleet captured one, the Rimnak, shortly after its
construction in 2378. Production of the class was discontinued in 2378.
Of the 10 H type Bloodhawk-class warbirds built, 7 remain in active
service. 2 have been destroyed and one is listed as lost, presumed
destroyed. The Bloodhawk is no longer in production and building was  
suspended in 2379. 
Of the 10 I type Raptor-class warbirds built, six remain in service and
four have been destroyed. Production of the class ended in 2379.
Of the 21 J type Decius-class warbirds constructed, 20 remain in
active service with one listed as destroyed. The Decius remains in
production at a rate of 2 new vessels per year.
Of the 17 K type Terex-class warbirds built, 16 remain in active
service with one listed as destroyed. The Terex remains in production at
a rate of 2 new vessels per year.

As a tactical asset geared toward taking the fight to the enemy, the Rath-class 
attack cruiser has few peers in any of the Alpha Quadrant fleets. No other vessel 
of comparable size is able to match the Raths raw firepower or ability to consistently 
deal out massive amounts of damage. Unfortunately for the Romulans, building only a 
handful of these marvelous vessels nearly bankrupted their fleet procurement process.  
The Rath is roughly twice the size of a Klingon B’rell-class scout, but devotes much 
more space to crew accommodations and fuel storage. Her rapid fire RPL-4 plasma 
torpedo array is unique to the class and occupies a pair of wing mounted exterior 
pods near the dorsal wing roots. During the Dominion War, the Raths were used as 
raiding vessels who acted in pairs against Dominion depots deep in enemy space. 
Acting in concert, the duo would swoop into an enemy base, decloak and unleash a 
withering volley of plasma weaponry. With the enemy thrown into chaos, the Raths 
would either recloak and move on to the next target of opportunity or lurk nearby 
until vulnerable rescue units moved into the area. Of the 8 Rath-class attack cruisers built, 
6 remain in active service. One was destroyed, while the other, the Rehan, was 
listed as lost, presumed destroyed after encountering an unclassified spacial rift near the Klingon Border.

The Algeron-class cruiser’s design is clearly inspired by a fusion of the Pyre and Warbird-class vessels, 
and greatly expands on the capabilities of both of those vessel types. At barely half the length of a Warbird,
the Algeron is still an imposing vessel with a good blend of offensive firepower and defensive staying power. 
Her shields are of a slightly less efficient type that what is in general use at this time, but are sufficient 
for the class’ needs. In the field, the Algeron makes a fine surveyor and explorer, an aspect of vessel 
design that the Romulan fleet has let fall by the wayside in recent years. At the very least, 
the Algeron is one of the longest ranged vessels in their fleet and sports a number of special machine shops 
capable of turning out parts that can keep the Algeron’s on the go for years at a time. While engaged in 
combat operations, these facilities can become invaluable to other vessels seeking her service in an 
attempt to press home the fight without wasting time in a drydock. In an effort to exploit her 
exploration capability, the Algeron sports a unique docking system that allows a Vastam-class scout to 
attach to the underside of the mothership between the warp nacelles. In this manner, on a long mission 
Vastam crews can enjoy the facilities of the Algeron, refuel and perform maintenance. On the flip side, 
the parent vessel can utilize the Vastam as an advance scout in unexplored regions or send her into 
areas where she would dare not go. Of the 24 Algeron-class cruisers built to date, 18 are in active 
service. Six have been destroyed in the line of duty. Production of the Algeron continues 
at a rate of two new vessels per year

Part science vessel and part fleet cruiser, the Avian has amassed a respectable  
operational record since it was introduced into service. Avian crews paid a terrific
price during the Dominion War and were often used as a screening command ship with two or 
three Mandukar’s at the point of a main body of Warbirds. They were often singled out for
destruction by the Cardassians because of their reputation of dishing out a healthy rate of 
disruptor fire. As science vessels, the Avians typically operate with one or two Vastam-class 
scouts as a mini task force in unexplored space. In this role they have been modestly successful 
and are one of the longer ranged vessels in the Romulan inventory. For any Romulan officer looking 
to expand his experience in the science fields, there are few better assignments than an Avian. 
Of the 40 Avian-class cruisers built, 18 remain in active service. 19 have been destroyed, two 
have been scrapped and one is listed as missing, presumed destroyed.The class is notable for the 
unique paint schemes that the yard workers apply to the “bird” pattern on each vessel’s dorsal hull. 
These colorful works of art are a point of pride for Avian crews and a contributing 
factor to the high morale that these ships enjoy.

It not quite clear when the Battlehawk-class cruiser first entered the Romulan Fleet inventory, but it is easy to say
that the design has nearly exceeded is usefulness as a fleet asset. Her shields are woefully underpowered in the face
of modern firepower and her ability to provide serious weapons fire is modest at best. For sure, the Battlehawks are
sturdy vessels and are useful in a number of fleet support roles, but their time is quickly coming to a close. Even
upgrading the class as a whole has been deemed unfeasible, and I the next ten years half of the existing vessels will
most likely be reverted to mothball status or scrapped. The remaining vessels may either serve out their operational
lifespan or be relegated to reserve status.
Obviously, the class was the inspiration behind the Warbird-class, though the
Battlehawk is barely half the size of that impressive class. Nonetheless, the two are often
confused on long range scans, and the Romulans have used this in the past to mask fleet
movements against Starfleet along the Neutral Zone or the Dominion during that conflict.
In this, it can be said, the Battlehawks still provide a modest service to the Empire.
Of the 90 Battlehawk-class cruiser constructed to date, 44 remain in active service. 
23 have been destroyed, six are listed as missing, presumed destroyed, seven have been
scrapped and 10 have defected to the Romulan Free States. Construction of the class
ended sometime in the early 2350s.

The Hathos-class cruiser was a modest attempt to improve upon the disappointing 
Pyre-class and give the fleet a supplementary cruiser while the new generation of
D’deridex-class warbirds came on line. In this role the Hathos can be said to be slightly
more successful than her predecessor, but only slightly so. The Hathos has the
advantage of a modern torpedo type and decent disruptors, but on the whole lacks the
power or rate of fire to be a truly devastating weapons platform. It is difficult to find any
other praise for a class that can barely stand against Starfleet’s second line starships.
However, the Hathos is simple to build and maintain and does have its supporters within the Empire.
In 2377 the whole class was pulled from service for a period of three months after the
warship Klaskar mysteriously blew up while on a high warp run from Corellia Prime to
Romulus. A detailed analysis of her warp core assembly revealed serious manufacturing
defects that necessitated the scrapping of three other vessels of the class. The Klaskar
and the three other ships had been built together at the same yard nine years previously
and received defective parts from the same supplier.
Of the 50 Hathos-class cruisers built, 35 remain in active service. Seven have been
destroyed, 4 have been scrapped, and 4 have defected to the Romulan Free States.
Production of the class ended in 2372 after a short ten-year production run.

During the 2360s, the Romulans had been accused of being one-trick-ponies, a power
that had produced only one truly exceptional warship design in decades. The Kesix
finally makes up for that, and has been regarded as one of the finest cruisers fielded by
the Romulan Navy in decades. This rugged and much loved vessel is built to blaze a
trail before the fleet’s main body and is a symbol of Romulan technical prowess.
The Kesix is literally built around a pair of massive RPL-5 plasma weapons, a one-two
knockout punch that is the envy of many fleets. Her forward mounted plasma cannons
are a massive improvement upon the old RPW-G type and have finally given credence to
the design. Her top speed of warp 9.6 is moderately faster than the official fleet speed of
warp 9.4 and has gotten ships of the class clear of danger on more than one occasion.
Her sensor suite is easily the finest in the Empire, and the Romulans have taken to using
the Kesixs as heavy scouts when the use of smaller vessels may prove to be inappropriate.
Of the 18 Kesix-class cruises built, all remain in service. Construction of the class continues at a rate of three vessels per year.

For years after their introduction to fleet service, the
Manukar-class destroyer was considered to be a pariah, the
luckless class that no self-respecting officer would serve
aboard and no fleet commander wished to take into battle.
Early models were riddled with mainten298387ance issues and
were considered to be disturbingly underpowered in most
circles. Though she was intended to replace the T-10
destroyer of nearly a half-century before, it would be many
years before the Mandukar-class could be an accepted part of the fleet.

From the outset, the class was designed around a
withering volley of six forward mounted RPL-3 plasma
weapons. Without question, this battery of fire had no equal
anywhere in the Alpha or Beta quadrants, and early
intelligence estimates were alarming to say the least.
However, the Mandukar proved to be more of a paper tiger,
as it lacked to power all six of her primary weapons and her
other primary tactical systems simultaneously. The Mandy
(as she became known) was still a devastating weapons
platform, but it wouldn’t take long for opposing powers to
develop tactics to counter the threat she posed.

Later models of the class focused on increasing the
vessel’s available power output and experimented with
newer weapons systems. The B model (code named Mandelar) 
introduced in the 2350s has very little in common
with the initial batch of Mandukars and abandons the RPL-
3s in favor of a massive compliment of photon torpedoes.
The C type (code name Majyk) of the mid-2360s returned to
the plasma weapon array, but now possessed the power
reserves to pose a formidable threat against enemy capital
ships. In fact, they type C Mandukar is the most well armed
destroyer or fleet support vessel in service anywhere, a
point of pride for her elite crews.

Of the 54 type A Mandukar-class destroyers produced
between 2340 and 2366, 40 are still in service. Seven were
destroyed in the line of duty, two are listed as lost, presumed
destroyed, and five have defected to the Romulan Free States.

Of the 64 type B Manukar-class destroyers constructed to
date, 56 are still in service. Three were destroyed in the line
of duty, one was scrapped, one is listed as lost, presumed
destroyed, and three have defected to the RFS. Production
continues at a rate of two new vessels per year, though that
is expected to cease in the next two years.
Of the 38 type C Mandukar-class destroyers built, all
remain in active service. Production continues at four new units per year.

One of the more Combat  22 Person-scout type vessels successful in service today is the  
Romulan Vastam-class, a multi-role design that has served the fleet for over
two decades. This diminutive ship is by no means as combat oriented as
the Klingon B’rell or as sophisticated as the Federation Heimdall, but the
Vastam has proven that she can hold her own both on the battlefield and in the most far flung regions of the galaxy.
When developing the Vastam, the Romulans had one demand, and that
was speed. They wanted a vessel that could run rings around any other ship
at sublight velocities and blaze a path at high warp for weeks or even
140  months at a time. They were successful in this and were able to do so
without sacrificing her tactical systems or information gathering abilities.
To be sure, the vessels are cramped for long durations scouts, but the crews
enjoy the high morale and camaraderie that comes from knowing that they are a valued part of the fleet.
As an offensive asset, the Vastam is a capable opponent, especially
against similarly sized vessels or even older cruisers. However, few fleet
commanders would ever squander the Vastam in this risky manner as they
are perfectly suited for closing with the enemy to gather a wealth of sensor
information. Once this is accomplished, they disengage back to friendly
lines confident that the enemy will be unable to keep up.
When acting as a vessel of exploration, the Vastam has the ability to
operate independently if necessary, but their real forte is in cooperating
with other larger science oriented vessels to act as an advanced scout. They
serve to find the best routes, develop itineraries for their larger charges and
perform surveys of items of secondary importance. It is a system that the
Romulans have down to a science is the envy of many fleets throughout the
Alpha Quadrant. A minor variant of the Vastam omits the topside torpedo
launcher in favor of a latching system that allows the scout to dock with an
Algeron-class cruiser. In this parasite mode, the pair makes use of the
facilities of each other and help extend their exploration capabilities.
Of the 120 Vastam-class scouts that have entered service, 94 remain in
active service. nine have been destroyed, three have been scrapped, six are
listed as lost, presumed destroyed and six have defected to the Romulan
Free States. Production continues at a reduced rate of 2 per year.
