Warbird Class Battlecruiser





















In the mid-2340s, Starfleet intelligence began to get “sniffs” of a new Romulan warship type in operation across the Neutral Zone. Although  
Starfleet had not made contact with the Empire in several decades by this 
point, there always existed a keen interest in what their neighbors across  
the no-mans-land were up to. Long range scans revealed grainy images of 
a vessel of massive proportions, at least twice the size of and Federation          
starship and with an unusual power signature that defied the analysis of the best minds at Starfleet Engineering. Numerous attempts to penetrate the  Star Empire for information about this new vessel failed, and for many years Starfleet counted itself lucky that the Romulans had chosen to isolate themselves from the rest of the Alpha Quadrant. It wasn’t until 2364 that  the starship Enterprise got a first detailed look at the new Romulan behemoth, and the news wasn’t good. 
In the years since, much has been learned about the Warbird-class of 
Romulan battlecriusers. It is now known that the early versions of the class were badly under gunned and underpowered and were barely a match for the line starships of the day. It wasn’t until a modernization program  
started in 2356 that the Warbird began to grow as a serious contender in  
the field of galactic brinkmanship. From the start however, the Warbird was a wonderland of technological innovation and seemingly limitless potential.   
At the heart of the new class is a forced quantum singularity powerplant  
that provides power to her primary systems. Although the output is on par 
with a traditional M/AM arrangement, the advantage comes from never      
having to refuel the vessel during its operational lifetime. Once the reactor  
is brought on line, it stays that way. The tradeoff comes at the expense of a slightly lower top speed and manpower intensive maintenance needs. 
Over the years, the Romulans have continually upgraded the class and        
regularly abandon old models as new ones come on line. Different engine, 
disruptor and torpedo weapons have produced nearly a dozen subtypes of  
the class with some, like the B type D’Deridex remaining in production while others, like the type E Peregrine have fallen out of favor. Losses during the Dominion and Raven conflicts have brought about an additional six variants of the Warbird hullform in the last decade with more expected to follow. 
Each new generation of Warbird improves upon the last in some degree or    another, and the Romulans have become masters at finding new ways to  
expand the capabilities of their most cherished warship design.  
To date, Starfleet has captured three Warbirds of various types, though   
only the type E Peregrine-class Pi’kaht was taken with its quantum 
singularity core intact and running. Although all three vessels have yielded an enormous wealth of data, Starfleet has as yet been unable to reverse engineer the powerplant or at least restart the cores of the two remaining vessels. 
Current speculation holds that the cores are produced at a 
dedicated facility and the ship is built around the massive engine in space. The type A Warbird entered service in 2337 and immediately entered  wide scale production. In retrospect, the class was grossly underpowered 
and poorly gunned and was a poor match for existing Federation or Klingon  vessels of the day. However, the Warbird did demonstrate an enormous   
leap forward in the Romulan’s construction capabilities and techniques and  was an ominous portent of things to come in the next few years.  
The type B D’deridex was the direct result of information gleaned about 
the capabilities of the new Federation Galaxy-class starships. She was 
built with a completely new tactical suite and greater speed in mind. The  
D’deridex was envisioned as a specific counter to that perceived threat,   
though at a massive cost. Despite extensive losses of the D’deridexs  
during the Dominion and Raven conflicts, the ships of this type are still  
considered to be prestige assignments.   
The type C Talon was developed alongside the more powerful D’deridex 
class as an easier to build alternative to the grossly expensive flagship.     
Her suite of older but reliable RPL-3 plasma weapons were chosen over  
the then new and rare RTA-S torpedoes along with the easier to produce 
RWW-I disruptor banks. The Talons have never been choice assignments 
and took enormous losses during the Dominion and Raven conflicts.     
The type D Sparrowhawk was an experiment in turning the class into an   
all plasma gun platform. Slightly weaker shields and a poor torpedo array  marred the otherwise great potential of the class, and only a few were built.  
The type E Peregrine built upon the lessons learned from the   
Sparrowhawk and sports an all disruptor tactical array capable of a 
withering rate of fire. Upgraded heavy shields and weapons made the type  
E more sluggish in her handling, but the class was a complete success   
otherwise. The Peregrines were also grossly expensive to build and   
maintain and construction ended in 2379. 
The type F Kamarak was the first serious attempt to improve on the  
D’deridex design and has been only a partial success. Upgraded structural  systems, torpedo capacity, and shields came at the cost of a small  
measure of maneuverability, disruptor rate of power and secondary power  
generation. Although the Kamarak is in all respects superior to the  
D’deridex, most in the fleet find the elder type to be a more balanced   
defensive platform. One place the Kamarak does excel in over the   
D’deridex however is exploration, and the class has done much to expand   
the borders of the Empire in the last decade. Although the fleet’s smaller science vessels are fine at what they do, only the Kamarak‘s possess the  larger ship borne sensor platforms and telescopes that were specifically  designed for the class.                       





The type G Leviathan is an upgrade of the existing type A Warbird to
more modern specifications. Modest changes to her weapons array and
shields were almost secondary to bringing her computer systems,
sensors and crew support facilities up to modern specifications. The 
Leviathan has since become the second most prolific type of Warbird
next to the D’deridex and serves as the backbone of their fleet.
The H type Bloodhawk was developed with the Leviathan as a
dedicated intelligence asset. Great care went into improving her
cloaking performance and increasing her uncloaked sensor return. Like  
the Peregrine, the Bloodhawk was a fine warship but was much more
difficult to field and was quickly pulled from production. Naturally, only
the most loyal crews are chosen for service aboard the Bloodhawks.
The I type Raptor was a spirited attempt to add a massive set of 
plasma torpedoes to the class at the expense of several other systems.
Her shields and disruptor systems are adequate for the job, but the class
was not all it was hoped it would be. Plans exist to refit the six remaining
vessels of the type as dedicated command and control ships, though this
has as yet failed to take place.
The J type Decius is the second attempt to upgrade the aging
D’deridex, and in this it has been more of a success than the Kamarak.
Great care was taken in improving her fields of fire and shield systems
while a 35% increase in structural integrity has built a greater degree of
resiliency into the hull. The end result was a vessel that had finally
outstripped the D’deridex as a front line combatant. However, both  
types are still in production with talk of upgrading the existing B type
D’deridexs to the J standard in the next ten years. If this plan comes to
pass, the Romulans will plan to do so at a rate of four units per year, just as they did with the Leviathans.
The K type Terex is a massively complex and over gunned upgrade of  
the Decius class and is currently the most powerful ship type in the  
Romulan inventory. However, the class has been slow to reach fleet
service due to its complicated construction process and manpower
intensive maintenance needs. In the Decius, the Romulans have finally 
managed to mount plasma and photon torpedoes in the same hull along
with the most advanced secondary systems available. Rumors persist
that the class may give way to an even more powerful L type Avatar
class in the next few years, though these rumors are unconfirmed. If
true, the Romulans may finally be poised to shift the balance of power in
their favor along the Neutral Zone.
Of the 80 A type Warbirds produced, none remain in active service.
Thirty were refit to type G specifications, 27 were destroyed, four are
reported missing, presumed destroyed, 7 were scrapped, two are in the
Imperial Naval Training Command, two have been sold to private
interests within the Empire, 1 is in reserve status and one, the Tomed,
was captured by the Federation on stardate 4/7510. 7 have been
captured by or defected to the Romulan Free States. The A type is no
longer in production and was discontinued in 2372.  
Of the 82 type B D’Deridex-class warbirds produced, 42 remain in
active service. 34 have been destroyed, 5 have been scrapped and 1 is  
listed as missing, presumed lost. The type B is still in production at a
rate of 2 new units per year. 
Of the 37 type C Talon-class warbirds built, 9 remain in active service.
25 have been destroyed and three were scrapped. This type of warbird
is no longer being produced. 
Of the 15 type D Sparrowhawk-class warbirds built, 7 remain in active
service. 5 have been destroyed, two are listed as lost, presumed  
destroyed and one has been captured by the Romulan Free States. The
Sparrowhawk is no longer in production and was discontinued in 2379.
Of the 19 E type Peregrine-class warbirds built, 8 remain in active
service. 8 have been destroyed, 1 is listed as missing, presumed lost,
one has been scrapped and one, the Pi’kaht was captured by Starfleet
on stardate 4/8002. The Peregrines are no longer in production and
were discontinued in 2379. 
Of the 20 F type Kamarak-class warbirds built, 15 remain in active 
service. Five have been destroyed. The F type warbird is still produced
at a rate of two new vessels per year.    
Of the 42 G type Leviathan-class warbirds placed in service, twelve
were built specifically as that class and 30 were refit from type A
Warbirds. 34 remain in active service while 6 have been destroyed, 1
was scrapped and Starfleet captured one, the Rimnak, shortly after its
construction in 2378. Production of the class was discontinued in 2378.
Of the 10 H type Bloodhawk-class warbirds built, 7 remain in active
service. 2 have been destroyed and one is listed as lost, presumed
destroyed. The Bloodhawk is no longer in production and building was  
suspended in 2379. 
Of the 10 I type Raptor-class warbirds built, six remain in service and
four have been destroyed. Production of the class ended in 2379.
Of the 21 J type Decius-class warbirds constructed, 20 remain in
active service with one listed as destroyed. The Decius remains in
production at a rate of 2 new vessels per year.
Of the 17 K type Terex-class warbirds built, 16 remain in active
service with one listed as destroyed. The Terex remains in production at
a rate of 2 new vessels per year.














































































                                                 







































Mandukar Class Destroyer

For years after their introduction to fleet service, the
Manukar-class destroyer was considered to be a pariah, the
luckless class that no self-respecting officer would serve
aboard and no fleet commander wished to take into battle.
Early models were riddled with mainten298387ance issues and
were considered to be disturbingly underpowered in most
circles. Though she was intended to replace the T-10
destroyer of nearly a half-century before, it would be many
years before the Mandukar-class could be an accepted part of the fleet.

From the outset, the class was designed around a
withering volley of six forward mounted RPL-3 plasma
weapons. Without question, this battery of fire had no equal
anywhere in the Alpha or Beta quadrants, and early
intelligence estimates were alarming to say the least.
However, the Mandukar proved to be more of a paper tiger,
as it lacked to power all six of her primary weapons and her
other primary tactical systems simultaneously. The Mandy
(as she became known) was still a devastating weapons
platform, but it wouldn’t take long for opposing powers to
develop tactics to counter the threat she posed.

Later models of the class focused on increasing the
vessel’s available power output and experimented with
newer weapons systems. The B model (code named Mandelar) 
introduced in the 2350s has very little in common
with the initial batch of Mandukars and abandons the RPL-
3s in favor of a massive compliment of photon torpedoes.
The C type (code name Majyk) of the mid-2360s returned to
the plasma weapon array, but now possessed the power
reserves to pose a formidable threat against enemy capital
ships. In fact, they type C Mandukar is the most well armed
destroyer or fleet support vessel in service anywhere, a
point of pride for her elite crews.

Of the 54 type A Mandukar-class destroyers produced
between 2340 and 2366, 40 are still in service. Seven were
destroyed in the line of duty, two are listed as lost, presumed
destroyed, and five have defected to the Romulan Free States.

Of the 64 type B Manukar-class destroyers constructed to
date, 56 are still in service. Three were destroyed in the line
of duty, one was scrapped, one is listed as lost, presumed
destroyed, and three have defected to the RFS. Production
continues at a rate of two new vessels per year, though that
is expected to cease in the next two years.
Of the 38 type C Mandukar-class destroyers built, all
remain in active service. Production continues at four new units per year.
