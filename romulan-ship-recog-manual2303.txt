Combat Efficiency: |. ° ee that as more and more of the Type 2s
became available, the Type 1s were
taken out of production, and those
existing models were refit and modified
as Type 2s. The Type 2s use a newer,
lighter version of the same engine,
which requires less space and allows
for more room in the crew compart-
ments.

Of the approximately 2500 H-4
warpshuttles built, about 2,000 are stil!
in service. About 30% of the remaining
vessels have been lost or destroyed;
another 40% are in reserve fleets. By
best count, at least 28 Type 1s and 121
Type 2s are operating within the civil
sector. Current production capabilities
are estimated to add an additional 50
Type 2s per year to the number in ser-
vice.

concerning information on the Romulan Star Navy. This comprehensive study discloses, for the first
time, all known combat, visual, and historical data on 40 different Romulan ships and their variants. .
Also included is a chronology of service and silhouette recognition chart. This manual is a must for a
all Star Trek enthusiasts. -
