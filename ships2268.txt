FOREWORD

THIS BOOK PROBABLY REALLY STARTED SOMEWHERE IN THE LATE 1970’S.
BACK THEN, | WAS A LITTLE TYKE INTERESTED IN THE ‘GEE WHIZ’ ASPECTS
OF SCIENCE FICTION, PARTICULARLY THE SHIPS AND TECHNOLOGY SHOWN ON
STAR TREK WHILE IT WAS IN SYNDICATION. TO WHET MY APPETITE EVEN
MORE, MY UNCLE WAS A ‘FICTIONAL TECHNOLOGY’ FAN AS WELL AND HAD A
LARGE NUMBER OF ‘STARSHIP’ BOOKS, BOTH OFFICIAL AND NOT, FROM THE
EARLY DAYS OF STAR TREK’S FANDOM. NEEDLESS TO SAY, | GOT INTO THEM
AN AWFUL LOT, MUCH TO HIS CHAGRIN.
OF COURSE, STILL AS A LITTLE TYKE, | WAS TRACING THE DRAWINGS FROM
FRANZ JOSEPH’S TECHNICAL MANUAL AND MAKING NEW SHIP DESIGNS OF MY
OWN. | DIDN’T KNOW A THING ABOUT WARP DYNAMICS AND ALL THE OTHER
DETAILS NOW CALLED ‘TREKNOLOGY’. | SIMPLY WANTED TO MAKE A LOT OF
NEW SHIPS AND HAVE FUN DRAWING THEM.
SINCE THAT TIME, THERE’S BEEN A NUMBER OF NEW STAR TREK TELEVISION
SHOWS, COUNTLESS FAN PUBLICATIONS, ROLE-PLAYING GAMES, AND OTHER
ODDS AND ENDS THAT HELPED FLESH OUT THE 7REK UNIVERSE | GREW UP
WITH. AND, NATURALLY, THERE WERE MORE SHIPS THE FUEL MY IMAGINATION.
CSEVERAL OF THOSE SHIPS APPEAR HERE.)
SO THIS BOOK GOES OUT TO MY UNCLE MIKE, WHO WAS KIND ENOUGH NOT
ONLY TO PUT UP WITH MY GETTING INTO HIS COOL THINGS ALL THE TIME,
BUT FOR ALSO ENCOURAGING ME TO DREAM AND IMAGINE, ESPECIALLY DURING
THOSE TIMES | NEEDED TO LOOK FORWARD THE MOST.
IT ALSO GOES OUT TO BOTH THE CREATORS OF S7AR TREK, AND THE MANY
FANS WHO JOINED INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE SERIES AND THE UNIVERSE IT PRE-
SENTED WITH THEIR OWN CREATIVE WORKS. THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU FOR
FILLING A YOUNG BOY’S DREAMS.

EDITOR’S ANNOTATIONS FASA VERSION. STAR TREK MAKES IT PRETTY CLEAR THAT
EASILY ONE OF FASA’S MOST POPULAR SHIP DESIGNS, THE DEFLECTOR DISHES WERE REQUIRED COMPONENTS OF FED-

FRIGATE. AS OPPOSED TO THE ‘YOU HAVE TO BE SPECIAL TO SHIPS DON’T HAVE THEM, THOUGH.
BE ON A CONNIE’, THE LOKWVAAR WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE
GOOD SHIP THAT MOST FEDERATION OFFICERS COULD GET IF ONE ODDITY NOT LOST ON STARSHIP FANS IS THAT THE
THEY TRIED. THE CHARACTER GENERATION RULES OF THE LOKNAA LOOKS PRETTY FAMILIAR THESE DAYS AS THE INSPI-
GAME REINFORCED THIS TO A DEGREE AS WELL. MOST FED- RATION FOR THE USS AKIRA, FROM FIRST CONTACT, AND THEN
ERATION OFFICERS WOULD NEVER SEE SERVICE ABOARD A FROM THAT THE EV7ERPAISE FROM S7AA THEK: ENTERPAISE.

FASA-INSPIRED DESIGN WORMED ITS WAY INTO ‘CANON’
WHILE THE FASA DESIGN IS ‘OFFICIAL’, IT’S NOT ‘CANON’ IN SOMEHOW.
THAT IT NEVER APPEARS ON SCREEN ANYWHERE (UNLIKE A
FEW OTHER ODDBALL FASA DESIGNS). IT IS, HOWEVER, PROBA-
BLY ONE OF THOSE MOST RECOGNIZABLE “ORIGINAL TREK’
SHIPS OUT THERE, ASIDE FROM THOSE IN FRANZ JOSEPH’S
TECHNICAL MANUAL.
THE SHIPS ARE TAKEN FROM FASA’S LISTS, BUT THE REGIS-
TRIES OF THE VESSELS ARE TONED DOWN TO REFLECT A
MORE CONTEMPORARY VIEW OF THE FLEET. ORIGINALLY, OVER
120 SHIPS OF THIS CLASS WERE LISTED, BUT THE VIEW TAKEN
HERE IS OF A MORE MODEST FIT OF TWENTY VESSELS.
VISUALLY, THE ONLY REAL DIFFERENCES PRESENTED HERE ARE
A FEW MORE ADDED DETAILS AND TEXTURING, AND THE PRES-
ENCE OF A DEFLECTOR DISH, NOTABLY MISSING FROM THE

TO DO IT ENOUGH JUSTICE. CERTAINLY, EVEN 40 YEARS AFTER OF THE GAPS HAVE BEEN FILLED IN FROM VARIOUS OFFICIAL
THE ORIGINAL STAR TREK SERIES WAS WRAPPED UP, THE SHIP SOURCES, SUCH AS LICENSED ROLE-PLAYING GAMES AND
REMAINS ETCHED IN THE MINDS OF MILLIONS OF SCIENCE- TECHNICAL MANUALS, WITH THE FRANZ JOSEPH 7ECHNICAL
FICTION FANS AROUND THE WORLD. IT IS SIMPLY THE MOST MANUAL AND BJO TRIMBLE’S S7AA TREK: CONCORDANCE
FAMOUS VESSEL, REAL OR IMAGINED, IN ALL HISTORY. GETTING THE FIRST NODS.
UNLIKE LATER S7AA TREK SHOWS, HOWEVER, S7AA 7AEK DID IF THAT WEREN’T ENOUGH, EVEN THE ACTUAL DESIGN OF THE
NOT OFFER A LOT OF DETAIL TO THE OVERALL CLASS OF THE SHIP IS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO WORK WITH, DESPITE IT HAVING
SHIP. WE KNOW, BASICALLY, THAT THE SHIP IS A RELATIVELY BEEN SEEN FOR YEARS BY SO MANY FANS. THE ‘OFFICIAL’
RARE *STARSHIP’, AND TOP OF THE LINE. WE SEE A FEW OF DRAWINGS OF THE SHIP WERE OFTEN AT ODDS WITH ONE
HER SISTER SHIPS, WE ALSO HEAR ‘THERE’S ONLY TWELVE ANOTHER. THE MOST FAMOUS SCHEMATICS, FROM THE FRANZ
LIKE HER IN THE FLEET’, WHICH GETS A LITTLE PROBLEMATIC JOSEPH 7ECHMICAL MANUAL HAD SOME NOTABLE DISCREP-
TO DEAL WITH, ANCIES. THE ILLUSTRATION USED HERE, THOUGH, STARTS WITH

THAT VERSION OF THE DESIGN, AND RECONCILES IT A LITTLE

ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THAT, OVER THE YEARS, MANY SPECU- MORE WITH WHAT’S BEEN SHOWN ON SCREEN.
LATIVE WORKS, OFFICIAL OR NOT, ASSUME THAT EVERY
STARSHIP MENTIONED BY NAME, NUMBER, OR INFERENCE, OF ALL THE SHIPS IN THIS GUIDE, THIS ONE WAS PROBABLY
MUST BE A CONST/TUTION-CLASS SHIP. NOT ONLY THAT, BUT THE HARDEST TO ACTUALLY GET DOWN. THE EXPECTATIONS
EVERY SHIP MENTIONED ALSO MUST MATCH THE REGISTRIES ARE HIGH, AND THERE ARE MANY, MANY CONFLICTING
GIVEN ON A WALL CHART IN ONE EPISODE - A CHART WITH SOURCES OF INFORMATION ABOUT HER. HOPEFULLY, THIS EN-
NEITHER ANY SHIP NAMES OR CLASSES ON IT. THIS MAKES NO TRY SERVES AS A HAPPY MEDIUM WITH EVERYTHING THAT’S
REAL SENSE, AND HAS BEEN DITCHED. THE VIEW HERE IS THAT OUT ABOUT HER.

EDITOR’S ANNOTATIONS

THE DECATUR FIRST APPEARED AS A LONE STARSHIP IN TODD

GUENTHER’S SHIPS OF THE STAAFLEET GUIDE. IT QUICKLY

BECAME A FAVORITE AMONG S7AA TREK FANS AND HAS

MADE SEVERAL APPEARANCES IN OTHER WORKS, THOUGH

WITH OFTEN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DETAILS.

THE ORIGINAL DESIGN ONLY CALLED FOR THE DECATUR HER-

SELF TO HAVE A ‘SERIES-ERA’ DESIGN, WITH THE REST OF THE

CLASS HAVING ‘MOVIE-ERA’ LINES. HERE, THE ASSUMPTION IS

THAT THE SHIP IS A BIT OF AN OLDER DESIGN WHICH GETS

REFIT AND THEN EXPANDED UPON AFTER 2271.

THE REGISTRY SCHEME GIVEN BY S7AASHIP DESIGN IS LISTED

AS MUCH HIGHER THAN WHAT’S GIVEN HERE. THAT GUIDE HAS

THE DECATUR AS NCC-2501. THIS IS A BIT HARD TO RATION-

ALIZE WITH THE ‘CONSTELLATION’ AS THE LAST TMP-ERA

EDITOR’S ANNOTATIONS

THE SURYAFIRST APPEARED IN ARIDAS SOFIA’S SHIPS OF THE

STARA FLEET, THEN WOULD MAKE MANY APPEARANCES IN

OTHER FAN WORKS, AND WOULD ALSO BE ONE OF THE MOST

POPULAR OF MODEL KITS FOR THE S7AA 7AEK ORIGINAL SE-

RIES ERA. THE REASON MAY BE OBVIOUS, IT’S AN OBVIOUS

‘RETRO-FITTING’ OF THE USS RELIANT FROM THE WRATH OF

KHAN.

THE SURYAWAS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO BE A PRECURSOR

TO THE AEL/ANT, AND SO THAT BACKSTORY WAS LARGELY

USED HERE. THE ONLY ADDITION IS THAT THE SURYA IS NOW A

BIT OLDER, SERVIING MORE AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN THE AWV/70N

CLASS AND WHAT WOULD BECOME THE MIRANDA CLASS.

THE SURYA, AS SHE APPEARS HERE, IS PRETTY MUCH RIGHT

OUT OF THE SHIPS OF THE STAR FLEET DIAGRAMS, WITH ONLY

A FEW DIFFERENCES IN TEXTURING IN THE ‘ENGINEERING’ SEC-

TION TO BRING HER SLIGHTLY MORE IN LINE WITH THE AWV/70ON

AND THE EVENTUAL MIRANDA.

THE SHIP NAMES ARE TAKEN FROM ADRIAS SOFIA’S GUIDE,

THOUGH THE REGISTRIES HAVE BEEN ‘NUDGED’ A BIT CLOSER

TO THE WIRANDA CLASS. ONLY THE FIRST TEN SHIPS ARE

USED, WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE MIRANDA SUR-

PLANTED THE CLASS JUST A BIT EARLY.

EDITOR’S ANNOTATIONS THIS GUIDE ASSUMES THE SHIP’S AGE AS GIVEN IN WAATH OF
FOR ANYONE THAT’S SEEN 7HE WAATH OF KHAN, THE ORIGINS KHAN, BUT ASSIGNS THE NOW-ACCEPTED MIRANDA CLASS
OF THIS CLASS SHOULD BE OBVIOUS. OF COURSE, THAT’S NOT MONIKER. IT ALSO ASSUMES THAT THE CLASS IS AN UPGRADE
TO SAY THAT THIS SHIP’S DESIGN WAS EASY TO PIN DOWN. TO THE AWV70ON AND SURYA CLASSES, AS GIVEN IN THEIR
THE MOVIE ITSELF SHOWED THE USS AREL/ANT, OF COURSE, BACKSTORIES.
BUT SAID NOTHING ABOUT ITS CLASS OR OTHER DETAILS.
FANS WERE LEFT TO SPECULATE. FOR THE ORIGINAL SERIES PERIOD, THE SHIP WOULD BE A
MAINSTAY FRIGATE, A PROUD LEAD VESSEL NEARLY ON PAR
PRODUCTION NOTES FROM THE MOVIE LISTED THE SHIP AS A WITH OTHER MAJOR VESSLES OF THE PERIOD. OF COURSE, BY
MEMBER OF THE ‘AVENGER’ CLASS, A FACT THAT FANS TOOK THE TIME OF WEX7 GENERATION, THE SHIP’S STATUS HAS
TO HEART WHEN MAKING THEIR OWN BLUEPRINTS AND OTHER BEEN RELEGATED HEAVILY TO THE BACKGROUND, SERVING
SPIN-OFF DESIGNS. MOSTLY SUPPORT ROLES EVEN IN ITS UPGRADED CONFIGURA-
TIONS.
THIS GETS COMPOUNDED BY THE FASA ROLE-PLAYING GAME,
WHICH, IN A FIT OF ORIGINALITY, SIMPLY DUBBED THE CLASS
THE “RELIANT CLASS’ AND HAD DONE WITH IT. SO, NOW, THERE
WERE TWO OFFICIAL NAMES FOR THE CLASS.
NOT TO MAKE THINGS SIMPLER, BUT PERHAPS BE MORE DE-
FINITIVE, THE CLASS WAS OFFICIALLY DUBBED MIRANDA IN
STAA TREK: THE NEXT GENERA TION. THE ONLY PROBLEM
THERE IS THAT IT WAS DECLARED A NEW CLASS OF SHIP FOR
THE WRATH OF KHAN AS WELL. OF COURSE, THIS WOULD
MEAN THAT KHAN WOULDN’T BE FAMILIAR WITH IT, AND IT
CONFLICTS WITH THE SCRIPT AND NOVELIZATION OF THE
MOVIE, WHICH BOTH EXPLICITLY STATE THE SHIP IS AN ‘OLD
BUCKET’ BY THE TIME OF WAATH OF KHAN.

EDITOR’S ANNOTATIONS IN THE NCC-1900S, BUT ARE REALLY PRETTY MUCH FILLER

THE MACKENZIE APPEARED IN A ‘JAYNEZ SHIPS’ ARTICLE IN BETWEEN THE LATER WIRANOAS AND THE FIRST FEW SOYUZ

STARDATE MAGAZINE. IT WAS ANOTHER ‘FASA-BASH’ MEANT CLASS SHIPS.

FOR USE WITH THAT ROLE-PLAYING GAME. IT WAS AN ORIGI-

NAL SERIES DESIGN, BUT WITH THE COMPONENTS SHOWN, IT

WOULD BE MORE SIZABLE THAN THE EN/7EAPAISE, AND YET IT

WOULD STILL ONLY BE A FRIGATE!

THE VERSION HERE REDRAWS A NUMBER OF THE LINES, AND

USES THE “SMALL COMPONENTS’ FOUND ON THE CAPELLA

AND HELLESPONT. THE SECONDARY HULL LINES REMAIN PRI-

MARILY THE SAME, BUT JUST CLEANED UP A BIT.

THE FASA BACKSTORY SIMPLY DOESN’T WORK FOR S7AA

TREK OF THAT ERA, DESCRIBING A ‘MAQUIS IN REVERSE’, EF-

FECTIVELY, CUSTOM MAKING THESE SHIPS TO PROTECT THEIR

COLONIES. IT’S AN INTERESTING IDEA, BUT AS MANY TIMES AS

KIRK CONFRONTS KLINGONS IN THE YEARS, YOU WOULD THINK

THIS WOULD COME UP SOMETIME.

THE BACKSTORY GIVEN HERE IS SIMPLY BECAUSE THE SHIP

VISUALLY REMINDS ME OF A FIGHTING PUG. | CAN ALMOST SEE

THIS THING FIGHTING KLINGON AND ROMULAN SHIPS TWICE ITS
