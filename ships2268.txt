FOREWORD

THIS BOOK PROBABLY REALLY STARTED SOMEWHERE IN THE LATE 1970’S.
BACK THEN, | WAS A LITTLE TYKE INTERESTED IN THE ‘GEE WHIZ’ ASPECTS
OF SCIENCE FICTION, PARTICULARLY THE SHIPS AND TECHNOLOGY SHOWN ON
STAR TREK WHILE IT WAS IN SYNDICATION. TO WHET MY APPETITE EVEN
MORE, MY UNCLE WAS A ‘FICTIONAL TECHNOLOGY’ FAN AS WELL AND HAD A
LARGE NUMBER OF ‘STARSHIP’ BOOKS, BOTH OFFICIAL AND NOT, FROM THE
EARLY DAYS OF STAR TREK’S FANDOM. NEEDLESS TO SAY, | GOT INTO THEM
AN AWFUL LOT, MUCH TO HIS CHAGRIN.
OF COURSE, STILL AS A LITTLE TYKE, | WAS TRACING THE DRAWINGS FROM
FRANZ JOSEPH’S TECHNICAL MANUAL AND MAKING NEW SHIP DESIGNS OF MY
OWN. | DIDN’T KNOW A THING ABOUT WARP DYNAMICS AND ALL THE OTHER
DETAILS NOW CALLED ‘TREKNOLOGY’. | SIMPLY WANTED TO MAKE A LOT OF
NEW SHIPS AND HAVE FUN DRAWING THEM.
SINCE THAT TIME, THERE’S BEEN A NUMBER OF NEW STAR TREK TELEVISION
SHOWS, COUNTLESS FAN PUBLICATIONS, ROLE-PLAYING GAMES, AND OTHER
ODDS AND ENDS THAT HELPED FLESH OUT THE 7REK UNIVERSE | GREW UP
WITH. AND, NATURALLY, THERE WERE MORE SHIPS THE FUEL MY IMAGINATION.
CSEVERAL OF THOSE SHIPS APPEAR HERE.)
SO THIS BOOK GOES OUT TO MY UNCLE MIKE, WHO WAS KIND ENOUGH NOT
ONLY TO PUT UP WITH MY GETTING INTO HIS COOL THINGS ALL THE TIME,
BUT FOR ALSO ENCOURAGING ME TO DREAM AND IMAGINE, ESPECIALLY DURING
THOSE TIMES | NEEDED TO LOOK FORWARD THE MOST.
IT ALSO GOES OUT TO BOTH THE CREATORS OF S7AR TREK, AND THE MANY
FANS WHO JOINED INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE SERIES AND THE UNIVERSE IT PRE-
SENTED WITH THEIR OWN CREATIVE WORKS. THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU FOR
FILLING A YOUNG BOY’S DREAMS.

CLASS NAME: MACKENZIE GENERAL INFORMATION

CLASS DESIGNATION: LIGHT FRIGATE, CLASS I THE MACKENZIE ENTERED SERVICE PRIMARILY AS A ‘QUICK

CLASS COMMISSION: 2249 FIX’ TO THE PROBLEM OF HANDLING FREIGHT AND SUPPLIES

IN CERTAIN SECTORS OF SPACE. THE ORDER WAS FOR A

COMPLEMENT CSTD): ‘CHEAP FIGHTING SHIP’ THAT COULD BE DEPLOYED QUICKLY,
OFFICERS: 25 ALMOST AS IF THE FEDERATION WAS ON A WAR FOOTING.
CREW: 85

THE MACKENZIE FULFILLED THAT ROLE, USING THE SMALLER

DRIVE SYSTEM: HULL AND WARP ENGINES USUALLY RESERVED FOR SUPPORT
IMPULSE: FID-2 (0.75C), SHIPS, BUT ARMED WITH PHASERS AND TORPEDOES LIKE A
WARP: FWF-IS, TANDEM, (WF 5/7), LARGER SHIP. THE DOZEN ‘BULLDOGS’, AS THEY BECAME

KNOWN, WERE RUSHED INTO SERVICES WITHIN ONLY TWO

ARMAMENT CSTD): YEARS.

PHASERS: 3 BANKS/2 EACH TYPE FH-3
TORPEDOES: | BANK TYPE FP-I SPARTAN, EVEN CRAMPED, THE ‘MACS’ WERE DESIGNED AS
NO-NONSENSE SHIPS, AND QUICKLY GOT A REPUTATION AS

SUPPLEMENTAL CRAFT CSTD): SUCH IN AND OUT OF THE FLEET. NO ONE REALLY EVER
CLASS F SHUTTLECRAFT: 2 WANT TO SERVE ON ONE, BUT EVERYONE FELT A LITTLE
CLASS H TRAVEL POD: 2 BETTER WITH A ‘BULLDOG’ BEHIND THEM..

DIMENSIONS: THOUGH THE ORIGINAL NEED FOR THE MACKENZIE HAS SUB-
LENGTH: 218M SIDED AND THE CLASS ‘COMPLETED’, THEY STILL FIND SER-
BREADTH: 98M VICE ON THE FRONTIER IN BOTH COMBAT AND ESCORT
HEIGHT: 52M ROLES. THE REPUTATION OF THE TENACIOUS SHIPS REMAIN
MASS CDEADWEIGHT): S8KMT SOUND, AND THEIR AGE SEEMS TO ADD MORE TO THEIR

REPUTATION AS GRIZZLED SCRAPPERS.

THE FOLLOWING SHIPS OF THE MACKINZIE CLASS FRIGATE HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED AS PART OF THE FEDERATION STAR FLEET AS

* CLASS SHIP, ** LOST IN THE LINE OF DUTY, + UNDER CONSTRUCTION AS OF STARDATE 7505.00

EDITOR’S ANNOTATIONS IN THE NCC-1900S, BUT ARE REALLY PRETTY MUCH FILLER

THE MACKENZIE APPEARED IN A ‘JAYNEZ SHIPS’ ARTICLE IN BETWEEN THE LATER WIRANOAS AND THE FIRST FEW SOYUZ

STARDATE MAGAZINE. IT WAS ANOTHER ‘FASA-BASH’ MEANT CLASS SHIPS.

FOR USE WITH THAT ROLE-PLAYING GAME. IT WAS AN ORIGI-

NAL SERIES DESIGN, BUT WITH THE COMPONENTS SHOWN, IT

WOULD BE MORE SIZABLE THAN THE EN/7EAPAISE, AND YET IT

WOULD STILL ONLY BE A FRIGATE!

THE VERSION HERE REDRAWS A NUMBER OF THE LINES, AND

USES THE “SMALL COMPONENTS’ FOUND ON THE CAPELLA

AND HELLESPONT. THE SECONDARY HULL LINES REMAIN PRI-

MARILY THE SAME, BUT JUST CLEANED UP A BIT.

THE FASA BACKSTORY SIMPLY DOESN’T WORK FOR S7AA

TREK OF THAT ERA, DESCRIBING A ‘MAQUIS IN REVERSE’, EF-

FECTIVELY, CUSTOM MAKING THESE SHIPS TO PROTECT THEIR

COLONIES. IT’S AN INTERESTING IDEA, BUT AS MANY TIMES AS

KIRK CONFRONTS KLINGONS IN THE YEARS, YOU WOULD THINK

THIS WOULD COME UP SOMETIME.

THE BACKSTORY GIVEN HERE IS SIMPLY BECAUSE THE SHIP

VISUALLY REMINDS ME OF A FIGHTING PUG. | CAN ALMOST SEE

THIS THING FIGHTING KLINGON AND ROMULAN SHIPS TWICE ITS

SIZE FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN /7 CAN.

THE SHIP NAMES ARE TAKEN FROM THE CANADIAN

MACKENZIE CONTEMPORARY SHIPS, ALONG WITH SOME SUG-

GESTED ADDITIONS. THE REGISTRIES ARE PLACED FAIRLY HIGH

SKELETAL SUMMARY
2240 THE CAPELLA CLASS IS AUTHORIZED. IT IS THE FIRST
THE PROTOTYPE FWF-1 DRIVE SYSTEM SUCCESSFUL EM- ‘CONSTITUTION CONTEMPORARY’ TO BE LICENSED TO PRIVATE
PLOYED ON BONAVENTURE TEST-BED SHIP. FURTHER TRIALS USE AS NAVAL AUXILIARIES, THOUGH NONE EVER SERVE IN
APPROVED. THAT CAPACITY.
2243 THE LARSON CLASS IS LAUNCHED. INITIAL REPORTS OF THE
THE FWF-1 DAIVE SYSTEM IS APPROVED FOR USE ON FEDERA- CLASS INDICATE A PROBLEM WITH ITS SINGLE ENGINE DESIGN,
TION SHIPS. PLANS FOR THE USS CONSTITUTION, USS HERMES; LIMITING ITS MAXIMUM SAFE SPEED.
AND USS SALAQIN ARE APPROVED.
2250
2245 CHRISTOPHER PIKE IS GIVEN COMMAND OF THE USS ENTERPAI-
USS CONSTITUTION LAUNCHED, FOLLOWED SHORTLY BY USS PRISE AND IS SET OUT ON THE FIRST OF HIS THREE-YEAR
ENTEAPAISE. EACH SHIP IS GIVEN A ONE-YEAR SHAKEDOWN MISSIONS.
AND TRIAL CRUISE. BEFORE APPROPRIATED BUILDS ARE FINAL-
IZED. THE BUDGET-CONSCIOUS APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AP-
PROVES THE MACKENZIE CLASS OF FRIGATE TO SERVE AS
CAPTAIN ROBERT H. APRIL ASSUMES COMMAND OF THE USS BORDER DEFENSE.
ENTERPRISE.
HERMES CLASS SCOUT FINALLY LAUNCHED. THE SINGLE FWF-1
2246 ENGINE PROVES PROBLEMATIC AT HIGHER WARP SPEEDS, BUT
THE TWO LEAD CONST/TUTION CLASS SHIPS RETURN WITH REMAINS IN PRODUCTION AS ‘EFFECTIVE’.
TREMENDOUS SUCCESS. BOTH SHIPS ARE AUTHORIZED FOR A
THREE-YEAR EXPLORATION MISSION INTO FEDERATION EX- 225l
PANSES. FP-3 HEAVY TORPEDO AUTHORIZED FOR USE ON STARSHIPS.
NO CURRENT SHIP DESIGN HAS A TORPEDO-BAY LARGE
A NEW DESIGN FOR THE AWV/70ON CLASS IS FINALLY APPROVED ENOUGH FOR THE NEW SYSTEM, HOWEVER, AND NEW SHIP
AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE CLASS FORMALLY BEGINS. DESIGNS ARE AUTHORIZED TO MAKE USE OF THEM.
THE FWF-'S IS APPROVED FOR USE ON STARFLEET VESSELS. DESPITE PROBLEMS WITH THE LARSON AND HERMES CLASS
SHIPS, THE SALAQIN CLASS IS PUT INTO PRODUCTION. WHILE
2247 STILL SUFFERING THE ‘IMBALANCE’ PROBLEM WITH ONE NA-
THE RANGER CLASS USS CONSTELLATION \S ORDERED TO BE CELLE, THE CLASS SERVES WELL IN ITS INTENDED ROLE.
REFIT TO CONSTITUTION CLASS SPECIFICATIONS AS A FEASI-
BILITY STUDY. THE REFIT EFFORT PROVES TOO COSTLY AND THE SURYA CLASS IS PUT INTO PRODUCTION, EFFECTIVELY
TIME-CONSUMING COMPARED WITH SIMPLY BUILDING NEW REPLACING THE AN/70ON CLASS. THE ANTON CLASS IS DE-
SHIPS OF THE CONST/TUTION CLASS AND IS NOT ATTEMPTED CLARED ‘COMPLETED’ AND NOT RE-OPTED FOR NEW SHIPS OF
AGAIN. THE TYPE.
2248 2252
USS BATON ROUGE CLASS AND CONTEMPORARIES ARE OFFI- THE 7AURUS CLASS CRUISER IS LAUNCHED. THOUGH FILLING A
CIALLY DESIGNATED AS ‘CLASS II’. NEWER SHIPS ORDERED IN NEEDED ROLE IN THE FLEET. DESPITE IT BEING A SOLID PER-
LARGER NUMBERS TO BEGIN A ‘PHASE-OUT’ PROJECT. FORMER, THE CLASS IS NOT WELL RECEIVED BY ITS CREWS,
PARTICULARLY ENGINEERING STAFF.
2249
USS CONSTITUTION AND USS ENTERPRISE RETURN FROM THEIR A NEW “WEAPONS MODULE” IS DESIGNED TO HOUSE THE NEW
FIRST HISTORIC THREE-YEAR MISSIONS. EACH SHIP IS GIVEN AN FP-3 TORPEDO SYSTEM. THE MODULE IS APPROVED TO BE
18 MONTH REFIT AND THE CONSTITUTION CLASS IS FINALLY THE MAIN HOUSING FOR THE HEAVY WEAPON, AND A NEW
FULLY AUTHORIZED. DESTROYER AND FRIGATE ARE AUTHORIZED TO CARRY THE
WEAPON.
THE USS CONSTELLATION COMPLETES ITS REFIT, WELL OVER-
BUDGET AND OVER MOST TIME ESTIMATES. THE REFIT PLAN IS THE MACKENZIE CLASS IS ‘COMPLETE’, FILLING IN THE
SADLY SCRAPPED, EVEN THOUGH THE CONSTELLATION HER- ‘EMERGENCY NEED’ FOR FRIGATE ESCORT IN VULNERABLE
