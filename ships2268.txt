FOREWORD

THIS BOOK PROBABLY REALLY STARTED SOMEWHERE IN THE LATE 1970’S.
BACK THEN, | WAS A LITTLE TYKE INTERESTED IN THE ‘GEE WHIZ’ ASPECTS
OF SCIENCE FICTION, PARTICULARLY THE SHIPS AND TECHNOLOGY SHOWN ON
STAR TREK WHILE IT WAS IN SYNDICATION. TO WHET MY APPETITE EVEN
MORE, MY UNCLE WAS A ‘FICTIONAL TECHNOLOGY’ FAN AS WELL AND HAD A
LARGE NUMBER OF ‘STARSHIP’ BOOKS, BOTH OFFICIAL AND NOT, FROM THE
EARLY DAYS OF STAR TREK’S FANDOM. NEEDLESS TO SAY, | GOT INTO THEM
AN AWFUL LOT, MUCH TO HIS CHAGRIN.
OF COURSE, STILL AS A LITTLE TYKE, | WAS TRACING THE DRAWINGS FROM
FRANZ JOSEPH’S TECHNICAL MANUAL AND MAKING NEW SHIP DESIGNS OF MY
OWN. | DIDN’T KNOW A THING ABOUT WARP DYNAMICS AND ALL THE OTHER
DETAILS NOW CALLED ‘TREKNOLOGY’. | SIMPLY WANTED TO MAKE A LOT OF
NEW SHIPS AND HAVE FUN DRAWING THEM.
SINCE THAT TIME, THERE’S BEEN A NUMBER OF NEW STAR TREK TELEVISION
SHOWS, COUNTLESS FAN PUBLICATIONS, ROLE-PLAYING GAMES, AND OTHER
ODDS AND ENDS THAT HELPED FLESH OUT THE 7REK UNIVERSE | GREW UP
WITH. AND, NATURALLY, THERE WERE MORE SHIPS THE FUEL MY IMAGINATION.
CSEVERAL OF THOSE SHIPS APPEAR HERE.)
SO THIS BOOK GOES OUT TO MY UNCLE MIKE, WHO WAS KIND ENOUGH NOT
ONLY TO PUT UP WITH MY GETTING INTO HIS COOL THINGS ALL THE TIME,
BUT FOR ALSO ENCOURAGING ME TO DREAM AND IMAGINE, ESPECIALLY DURING
THOSE TIMES | NEEDED TO LOOK FORWARD THE MOST.
IT ALSO GOES OUT TO BOTH THE CREATORS OF S7AR TREK, AND THE MANY
FANS WHO JOINED INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE SERIES AND THE UNIVERSE IT PRE-
SENTED WITH THEIR OWN CREATIVE WORKS. THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU FOR
FILLING A YOUNG BOY’S DREAMS.

EDITOR’S ANNOTATIONS

WHEN 7HE WRATH OF KHAN CAME OUT, THERE WAS AN IM-

MEDIATE CURIOSITY ON THE PART OF MANY FANS TO IMAGINE

WHAT THE AEL/AN7 LOOKED LIKE DURING THE ORIGINAL SERIES.

FASA, WHO HAD THE RIGHTS TO THE ROLE-PLAYING GAME AT

THE TIME, TOOK THE CONCEPT AND EVENTUALLY CAME UP

WITH THE ANTON.

AS SHE APPEARED IN FASA’S FEDERATION RECOGNITION MAN-

UAL, THE AN7ON WAS AN ODD CROSS BETWEEN A ‘MOVIE-

ERA’ REFIT HULL, A ‘SERIES-ERA’ WARP DRIVE, AND A BRICK.

THE IDEA WASN'T TOO BAD, BUT THE ARTWORK JUST DIDN'T

MESH WITH WHAT WAS BEING PRESENTED. THE VERSION HERE

IS A ‘CLEANED UP’ VERSION, FOCUSING ON THE ‘SERIES’ AS-

PECTS, AS WELL AS REDOING SOME LINES TO BRING HER MORE

INTO THE SAME DESIGN ASTHETIC.

THE FASA BACK-STORY HAD THE ANTON BE DIRECTLY REFIT

TO THE AEL/ANT SPECIFICATIONS (MIRANDA, IN THIS CASE}.

RATHER THAN GO THAT ROUTE, THIS ASSUMES THAT THE

ANTON S DESIGN LESSONS WERE TAKEN TO HEART AND PUT

INTO THE SURYA AND MIRANDA WHEN THEY WERE COMMIS-

SIONED. THE AWV7ON HERSELF IS A RETIRED CLASS WHICH

WON’T SEE LIFE AFTER THE MOVIE-ERA REFITS.

WHEN DRAWING IT, IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO BALANCE OUT
ITS LOOK. THE CONNECTION BETWEEN HULLS WAS DIFFICULT,
AND THE ENGINES WOULD NEVER LOOK LESS THAN AWKWARD.

| HAD CONSIDERED DITCHING THE TAURUS TOGETHER, BUT IT
WAS ONE OF ONLY A FEW SHIPS FEATURED UNIQUELY TO
SPACEDOCK, A GUIDE WHICH | STRONGLY WANTED TO RECOG-
NIZE.
A PARTIAL SOLUTION WOULD COME FROM JOHN PAYNE
OF :INPAYNE STARSHIPS, AND HIS 7AIUMPH CLASS. HIS KIT-

AUS’S DESCRIPTION, THOUGH IT WASN’T THE MOST ATTRAC-
TIVE OF STARSHIPS. | DECIDED TO TAKE HIS IDEA AND APPLY IT
MORE DIRECTLY TO THE 7AUAUS, AND THE RESULT IS WHAT’S
SHOWN HERE.
THE TAURUS, THEN, IS BASICALLY JOHN’S 7AIUMPH CLASS

TIONAL WARP ENGINE ATOP IT. IT WORKS, MORE OR LESS.

TO SAY THAT THIS MATTHEW JEFFERIES’ ORIGINAL DESIGN ON WHAT'S BEEN SHOWN ON SCREEN OR CAN BE DIRECTLY
FOR THE EN7EAPAISE IS LEGENDARY DOESN’T SOMEHOW SEEM INFERRED WITHOUT MAKING TOO MANY ASSUMPTIONS. A FEW
TO DO IT ENOUGH JUSTICE. CERTAINLY, EVEN 40 YEARS AFTER OF THE GAPS HAVE BEEN FILLED IN FROM VARIOUS OFFICIAL

REMAINS ETCHED IN THE MINDS OF MILLIONS OF SCIENCE- TECHNICAL MANUALS, WITH THE FRANZ JOSEPH 7ECHNICAL

FAMOUS VESSEL, REAL OR IMAGINED, IN ALL HISTORY. GETTING THE FIRST NODS.
UNLIKE LATER S7AA TREK SHOWS, HOWEVER, S7AA 7AEK DID IF THAT WEREN’T ENOUGH, EVEN THE ACTUAL DESIGN OF THE
NOT OFFER A LOT OF DETAIL TO THE OVERALL CLASS OF THE SHIP IS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO WORK WITH, DESPITE IT HAVING

RARE *STARSHIP’, AND TOP OF THE LINE. WE SEE A FEW OF DRAWINGS OF THE SHIP WERE OFTEN AT ODDS WITH ONE
HER SISTER SHIPS, WE ALSO HEAR ‘THERE’S ONLY TWELVE ANOTHER. THE MOST FAMOUS SCHEMATICS, FROM THE FRANZ
LIKE HER IN THE FLEET’, WHICH GETS A LITTLE PROBLEMATIC JOSEPH 7ECHMICAL MANUAL HAD SOME NOTABLE DISCREP-
TO DEAL WITH, ANCIES. THE ILLUSTRATION USED HERE, THOUGH, STARTS WITH

THAT VERSION OF THE DESIGN, AND RECONCILES IT A LITTLE

ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THAT, OVER THE YEARS, MANY SPECU- MORE WITH WHAT’S BEEN SHOWN ON SCREEN.
LATIVE WORKS, OFFICIAL OR NOT, ASSUME THAT EVERY
STARSHIP MENTIONED BY NAME, NUMBER, OR INFERENCE, OF ALL THE SHIPS IN THIS GUIDE, THIS ONE WAS PROBABLY
MUST BE A CONST/TUTION-CLASS SHIP. NOT ONLY THAT, BUT THE HARDEST TO ACTUALLY GET DOWN. THE EXPECTATIONS
EVERY SHIP MENTIONED ALSO MUST MATCH THE REGISTRIES ARE HIGH, AND THERE ARE MANY, MANY CONFLICTING
GIVEN ON A WALL CHART IN ONE EPISODE - A CHART WITH SOURCES OF INFORMATION ABOUT HER. HOPEFULLY, THIS EN-

EDITOR’S ANNOTATIONS

THE DECATUR FIRST APPEARED AS A LONE STARSHIP IN TODD

GUENTHER’S SHIPS OF THE STAAFLEET GUIDE. IT QUICKLY

BECAME A FAVORITE AMONG S7AA TREK FANS AND HAS

MADE SEVERAL APPEARANCES IN OTHER WORKS, THOUGH

WITH OFTEN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DETAILS.

THE ORIGINAL DESIGN ONLY CALLED FOR THE DECATUR HER-

SELF TO HAVE A ‘SERIES-ERA’ DESIGN, WITH THE REST OF THE

CLASS HAVING ‘MOVIE-ERA’ LINES. HERE, THE ASSUMPTION IS

THAT THE SHIP IS A BIT OF AN OLDER DESIGN WHICH GETS

REFIT AND THEN EXPANDED UPON AFTER 2271.

THE REGISTRY SCHEME GIVEN BY S7AASHIP DESIGN IS LISTED

AS MUCH HIGHER THAN WHAT’S GIVEN HERE. THAT GUIDE HAS

THE DECATUR AS NCC-2501. THIS IS A BIT HARD TO RATION-

ALIZE WITH THE ‘CONSTELLATION’ AS THE LAST TMP-ERA

DESIGN LAUNCHING WITH NCC-1974, AND THE EXCELSIOR

CLASSES LARGELY TAKING OVER FROM NCC-2000 ONWARD.

THE NUMBERS GIVEN HERE ARE LOWERED TO THE NCC-1780

RANGE, KEEPING THEM A BIT TIGHTER WITH WHAT’S PRE-

SENTED IN S7AA TREK, AS WELL AS HELPING HELPING OUT

THE ROLE OF THE JECA7UA AS A CRUISER IN KIRK’S FLEET.

EDITOR’S ANNOTATIONS

THE SURYAFIRST APPEARED IN ARIDAS SOFIA’S SHIPS OF THE

STARA FLEET, THEN WOULD MAKE MANY APPEARANCES IN

OTHER FAN WORKS, AND WOULD ALSO BE ONE OF THE MOST

POPULAR OF MODEL KITS FOR THE S7AA 7AEK ORIGINAL SE-

RIES ERA. THE REASON MAY BE OBVIOUS, IT’S AN OBVIOUS

‘RETRO-FITTING’ OF THE USS RELIANT FROM THE WRATH OF

KHAN.

THE SURYAWAS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO BE A PRECURSOR

TO THE AEL/ANT, AND SO THAT BACKSTORY WAS LARGELY

USED HERE. THE ONLY ADDITION IS THAT THE SURYA IS NOW A

BIT OLDER, SERVIING MORE AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN THE AWV/70N

CLASS AND WHAT WOULD BECOME THE MIRANDA CLASS.

THE SURYA, AS SHE APPEARS HERE, IS PRETTY MUCH RIGHT

OUT OF THE SHIPS OF THE STAR FLEET DIAGRAMS, WITH ONLY

A FEW DIFFERENCES IN TEXTURING IN THE ‘ENGINEERING’ SEC-

TION TO BRING HER SLIGHTLY MORE IN LINE WITH THE AWV/70ON

AND THE EVENTUAL MIRANDA.

THE SHIP NAMES ARE TAKEN FROM ADRIAS SOFIA’S GUIDE,

THOUGH THE REGISTRIES HAVE BEEN ‘NUDGED’ A BIT CLOSER

TO THE WIRANDA CLASS. ONLY THE FIRST TEN SHIPS ARE

USED, WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE MIRANDA SUR-

PLANTED THE CLASS JUST A BIT EARLY.

OF THIS CLASS SHOULD BE OBVIOUS. OF COURSE, THAT’S NOT MONIKER. IT ALSO ASSUMES THAT THE CLASS IS AN UPGRADE
TO SAY THAT THIS SHIP’S DESIGN WAS EASY TO PIN DOWN. TO THE AWV70ON AND SURYA CLASSES, AS GIVEN IN THEIR
THE MOVIE ITSELF SHOWED THE USS AREL/ANT, OF COURSE, BACKSTORIES.
BUT SAID NOTHING ABOUT ITS CLASS OR OTHER DETAILS.
FANS WERE LEFT TO SPECULATE. FOR THE ORIGINAL SERIES PERIOD, THE SHIP WOULD BE A
MAINSTAY FRIGATE, A PROUD LEAD VESSEL NEARLY ON PAR
PRODUCTION NOTES FROM THE MOVIE LISTED THE SHIP AS A WITH OTHER MAJOR VESSLES OF THE PERIOD. OF COURSE, BY
MEMBER OF THE ‘AVENGER’ CLASS, A FACT THAT FANS TOOK THE TIME OF WEX7 GENERATION, THE SHIP’S STATUS HAS
TO HEART WHEN MAKING THEIR OWN BLUEPRINTS AND OTHER BEEN RELEGATED HEAVILY TO THE BACKGROUND, SERVING
SPIN-OFF DESIGNS. MOSTLY SUPPORT ROLES EVEN IN ITS UPGRADED CONFIGURA-
TIONS.
THIS GETS COMPOUNDED BY THE FASA ROLE-PLAYING GAME,
WHICH, IN A FIT OF ORIGINALITY, SIMPLY DUBBED THE CLASS
THE “RELIANT CLASS’ AND HAD DONE WITH IT. SO, NOW, THERE
WERE TWO OFFICIAL NAMES FOR THE CLASS.
NOT TO MAKE THINGS SIMPLER, BUT PERHAPS BE MORE DE-
FINITIVE, THE CLASS WAS OFFICIALLY DUBBED MIRANDA IN
STAA TREK: THE NEXT GENERA TION. THE ONLY PROBLEM
THERE IS THAT IT WAS DECLARED A NEW CLASS OF SHIP FOR
THE WRATH OF KHAN AS WELL. OF COURSE, THIS WOULD
MEAN THAT KHAN WOULDN’T BE FAMILIAR WITH IT, AND IT
CONFLICTS WITH THE SCRIPT AND NOVELIZATION OF THE
MOVIE, WHICH BOTH EXPLICITLY STATE THE SHIP IS AN ‘OLD
BUCKET’ BY THE TIME OF WAATH OF KHAN.

THE MACKENZIE APPEARED IN A ‘JAYNEZ SHIPS’ ARTICLE IN BETWEEN THE LATER WIRANOAS AND THE FIRST FEW SOYUZ

STARDATE MAGAZINE. IT WAS ANOTHER ‘FASA-BASH’ MEANT CLASS SHIPS.

FOR USE WITH THAT ROLE-PLAYING GAME. IT WAS AN ORIGI-

NAL SERIES DESIGN, BUT WITH THE COMPONENTS SHOWN, IT

WOULD BE MORE SIZABLE THAN THE EN/7EAPAISE, AND YET IT

WOULD STILL ONLY BE A FRIGATE!

THE VERSION HERE REDRAWS A NUMBER OF THE LINES, AND

USES THE “SMALL COMPONENTS’ FOUND ON THE CAPELLA

AND HELLESPONT. THE SECONDARY HULL LINES REMAIN PRI-

MARILY THE SAME, BUT JUST CLEANED UP A BIT.

THE FASA BACKSTORY SIMPLY DOESN’T WORK FOR S7AA

TREK OF THAT ERA, DESCRIBING A ‘MAQUIS IN REVERSE’, EF-

FECTIVELY, CUSTOM MAKING THESE SHIPS TO PROTECT THEIR

COLONIES. IT’S AN INTERESTING IDEA, BUT AS MANY TIMES AS

KIRK CONFRONTS KLINGONS IN THE YEARS, YOU WOULD THINK

THIS WOULD COME UP SOMETIME.
