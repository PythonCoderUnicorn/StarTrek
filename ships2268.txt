FOREWORD

THIS BOOK PROBABLY REALLY STARTED SOMEWHERE IN THE LATE 1970’S.
BACK THEN, | WAS A LITTLE TYKE INTERESTED IN THE ‘GEE WHIZ’ ASPECTS
OF SCIENCE FICTION, PARTICULARLY THE SHIPS AND TECHNOLOGY SHOWN ON
STAR TREK WHILE IT WAS IN SYNDICATION. TO WHET MY APPETITE EVEN
MORE, MY UNCLE WAS A ‘FICTIONAL TECHNOLOGY’ FAN AS WELL AND HAD A
LARGE NUMBER OF ‘STARSHIP’ BOOKS, BOTH OFFICIAL AND NOT, FROM THE
EARLY DAYS OF STAR TREK’S FANDOM. NEEDLESS TO SAY, | GOT INTO THEM
AN AWFUL LOT, MUCH TO HIS CHAGRIN.
OF COURSE, STILL AS A LITTLE TYKE, | WAS TRACING THE DRAWINGS FROM
FRANZ JOSEPH’S TECHNICAL MANUAL AND MAKING NEW SHIP DESIGNS OF MY
OWN. | DIDN’T KNOW A THING ABOUT WARP DYNAMICS AND ALL THE OTHER
DETAILS NOW CALLED ‘TREKNOLOGY’. | SIMPLY WANTED TO MAKE A LOT OF
NEW SHIPS AND HAVE FUN DRAWING THEM.
SINCE THAT TIME, THERE’S BEEN A NUMBER OF NEW STAR TREK TELEVISION
SHOWS, COUNTLESS FAN PUBLICATIONS, ROLE-PLAYING GAMES, AND OTHER
ODDS AND ENDS THAT HELPED FLESH OUT THE 7REK UNIVERSE | GREW UP
WITH. AND, NATURALLY, THERE WERE MORE SHIPS THE FUEL MY IMAGINATION.
CSEVERAL OF THOSE SHIPS APPEAR HERE.)
SO THIS BOOK GOES OUT TO MY UNCLE MIKE, WHO WAS KIND ENOUGH NOT
ONLY TO PUT UP WITH MY GETTING INTO HIS COOL THINGS ALL THE TIME,
BUT FOR ALSO ENCOURAGING ME TO DREAM AND IMAGINE, ESPECIALLY DURING
THOSE TIMES | NEEDED TO LOOK FORWARD THE MOST.
IT ALSO GOES OUT TO BOTH THE CREATORS OF S7AR TREK, AND THE MANY
FANS WHO JOINED INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE SERIES AND THE UNIVERSE IT PRE-
SENTED WITH THEIR OWN CREATIVE WORKS. THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU FOR
FILLING A YOUNG BOY’S DREAMS.

INTRODUCTION

| CANNOT HELP BUT RECOGNIZE A CERTAIN IRONY IN AUTHORIZING THIS GUIDE. AS CAPTAIN OF
THE US.S. CONSTELLATION, | WAS VERY MUCH SADDENED TO LEARN THAT THE VENERABLE
BATON ROUGE CLASS OF STARSHIP WAS NEARING THE END OF ITS STATUS AS ‘TOP OF THE
LINE’. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT THAT THE SHIPS | HAD, TO THAT POINT, SERVED ABOARD
WERE STARTING TO BE CONSIDERED ‘OBSOLETE’. AS A CREWMAN, AND MAYBE ESPECIALLY AS
A CAPTAIN, YOU WILL GET AN ATTACHMENT TO EACH VESSEL THAT YOU SERVE ABOARD, AND
IT CAN BE JUST AS HARD LEAVING A SHIP BEHIND AS A CLOSE RELATIVE OR OTHER LOVED
ONE.
| HAD FOUGHT TOOTH AND NAIL TO CONTINUE THE BATON ROUGE ERA JUST A LITTLE LONGER,
EVEN AUTHORIZING THE REBUILD OF MY OLD COMMAND TO THE NEW SPECIFICATIONS. OF
COURSE, EVENTUALLY, THOUGH, | HAD TO ACCEPT THAT THE NEW SHIPS OF THE LINE WERE
THE FUTURE OF THE FEDERATION. THE BATON ROUGE WAS THE LAST OF EARTH’S GREAT
SHIPS. THE CONST/TUTION WOULD BE THE FIRST OF THE FEDERATION’S.
THIS MANUAL SERVES AS A BASIC GUIDE TO THIS ‘FIRST GENERATION’ OF TRUE FEDERATION
STARSHIPS. ALONG WITH THE FAMOUS CONSTITUTION CLASS OF HEAVY CRUISER, THIS GUIDE
DETAILS OTHER FEDERATION WORKHORSES WHICH SERVE ALONGSIDE HER. EACH OF THESE VES-
SELS, THOUGH GIVEN A SPECIFIC FLEET DESIGNATION, IS DESIGNED TO POTENTIALLY FILL A
VARIETY OF ROLES. THESE ARE STARFLEET’S WORKHORSES, THE SHIPS THAT HAVE MADE BOTH
THE FEDERATION AND STARFLEET THE RESPECTED POWERS THAT THEY ARE TODAY.
TO THOSE SERVING ABOARD THESE VESSELS, AND THOSE WHO LOOK FORWARD TO THEIR SER-
VICE, | WISH YOU THE LOVE FOR YOUR SHIPS THAT | HAD OF MINE. AND | MUST ADMIT TO A
CERTAIN ENVY TO THOSE SERVING ABOARD THESE ‘SHIPS OF THE LINE’. GODSPEED ON YOUR
QUEST FOR THE FEDERATION’S FUTURE.

EDITOR’S ANNOTATIONS

THE ORIGINAL COCHISE APPEARED IN THE 7ECHNICAL MANUAL

AS A POTENTIAL REFIT DESIGN OF THE SALADIV CLASS OF

DESTROYER, THOUGH NO ARTWORK WAS GIVEN. THERE HAVE

BEEN MANY, MANY DIFFERENT VARIATIONS ON THE SALADIV

TO MAKE THIS SHIP BY VARIOUS FAN WORKS., BUT THERE

HASN’T BEEN A SOLID CONSENSUS TO USE FOR WHAT THIS

SHIP MAY ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE.

THE DESIGN USED HERE IS ACTUALLY BASED ON A KITBASH

USED FOR JEEP SPACE MINE, THOUGH THAT SHIP WAS OF THE

MOVIE-ERA DESIGNS. THAT SHIP WAS CLEARLY A DESTROYER,

MOUNTING A MIRANOA-STYLE WEAPONS POD BETWEEN TWO

WARP ENGINES. WHILE BEING ANOTHER *‘TREK-BASH’ USED

FOR THE SERIES, THE SHIP DID MAKE SENSE AS A COCHISE

DESTROYER VARIANT.

WHAT’S PRESENTED HERE IS A ‘RETRO-GRADED’ SHIP BASED

ON THE SHIP DESIGN SHOWN IN DEEP SPACE MINE. THE WEAP-

ONS POD COMES FROM THE MIRANDA SHOWN IN THIS GUIDE,

AND, OF COURSE, THE OTHER COMPONENTS ARE BASED ON

THE ORIGINAL SERIES’ EN7ERPAISE.

THE SHIP NAMES AND REGISTIRES ARE FROM THE S7AA TREK

TECHNICAL MANUAL, USING THE BULK OF THOSE SHIPS DE-

CLARED FOR THE COCHISE VARIANT OF THE SALADIN CLASS.

SHOWN HERE IS BASED ON BRIAN PIMENTA‘S INTENDED DESIGN

UP A BIT, ADDING SOME COMPONENTS FOUND ON OTHER

THIS DOESN’T END THE CLASS’S WOES, HOWEVER. THE SCRIPT

AND FREIGHTER AT VARIOUS POINTS. OBVIOUSLY, WE WEREN’T
SUPPOSED TO PAY TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO THE DETAILS OF

THE NAME ‘ANTARES’ REFERS TO A NAVY SUPPLY VESSEL
THAT SERVED AT PEARL HARBOR AT THE ONSET OF WORLD

AFTER WWII-ERA AUXILLARY SHIPS, WHICH IS THE REASONING
USED HERE.

EDITOR’S ANNOTATIONS

THE HELLESPONT’S NAME WAS TAKEN FROM STEVE LONG’S

SPACEDOCK SUPPLEMENT, THOUGH THE SHIP DESCRIBED

THERE WAS OF A DIFFERENT CONFIGURATION THAN THE ONE

PRESENTED HERE. ONLY THE ROLE OF ‘DESTROYER’ WAS IN

COMMON.

THE ACTUAL SHIP DESIGN, INSTEAD CAME FROM S7AA FLEET

BATTLES, AND WAS ONE OF THE MORE POPULAR DESIGNS

UNIQUE TO THAT GAME. THE ONLY DOWNSIDE WAS THAT

LITTLE WAS DETAILED ABOUT THE CLASS OUTSIDE OF ITS

COMBAT CAPABILITIES, EVEN WHAT CLASS THE FAST DE-

STROYER REALLY WAS! THIS TIME, MOST OF THE OTHER ‘LEG-

WORK’ HAD TO BE WOVEN FROM WHOLE CLOTH.

THE HELLESPONT SHIP NAMES WERE TAKEN FROM VARIOUS

GREEK MYTHOLOGICAL STORIES.

THE VISUAL DESIGN IS LARGELY JUST AS SHE APPEARED IN

THE S7AA FLEET BATTLES GAME, WITH SOME DETAILING DIF-

FERENCES, PARTICULARLY IN THE AFT ‘WING’ SECTION.

EDITOR’S ANNOTATIONS

WHEN 7HE WRATH OF KHAN CAME OUT, THERE WAS AN IM-

MEDIATE CURIOSITY ON THE PART OF MANY FANS TO IMAGINE

WHAT THE AEL/AN7 LOOKED LIKE DURING THE ORIGINAL SERIES.

FASA, WHO HAD THE RIGHTS TO THE ROLE-PLAYING GAME AT

THE TIME, TOOK THE CONCEPT AND EVENTUALLY CAME UP

WITH THE ANTON.

AS SHE APPEARED IN FASA’S FEDERATION RECOGNITION MAN-

UAL, THE AN7ON WAS AN ODD CROSS BETWEEN A ‘MOVIE-

ERA’ REFIT HULL, A ‘SERIES-ERA’ WARP DRIVE, AND A BRICK.

THE IDEA WASN'T TOO BAD, BUT THE ARTWORK JUST DIDN'T

MESH WITH WHAT WAS BEING PRESENTED. THE VERSION HERE

IS A ‘CLEANED UP’ VERSION, FOCUSING ON THE ‘SERIES’ AS-

PECTS, AS WELL AS REDOING SOME LINES TO BRING HER MORE

INTO THE SAME DESIGN ASTHETIC.

THE FASA BACK-STORY HAD THE ANTON BE DIRECTLY REFIT

TO THE AEL/ANT SPECIFICATIONS (MIRANDA, IN THIS CASE}.

RATHER THAN GO THAT ROUTE, THIS ASSUMES THAT THE

ANTON S DESIGN LESSONS WERE TAKEN TO HEART AND PUT

INTO THE SURYA AND MIRANDA WHEN THEY WERE COMMIS-

SIONED. THE AWV7ON HERSELF IS A RETIRED CLASS WHICH

WON’T SEE LIFE AFTER THE MOVIE-ERA REFITS.

EDITOR’S ANNOTATIONS

THE DECATUR FIRST APPEARED AS A LONE STARSHIP IN TODD

GUENTHER’S SHIPS OF THE STAAFLEET GUIDE. IT QUICKLY

BECAME A FAVORITE AMONG S7AA TREK FANS AND HAS

MADE SEVERAL APPEARANCES IN OTHER WORKS, THOUGH

WITH OFTEN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DETAILS.

THE ORIGINAL DESIGN ONLY CALLED FOR THE DECATUR HER-

SELF TO HAVE A ‘SERIES-ERA’ DESIGN, WITH THE REST OF THE

CLASS HAVING ‘MOVIE-ERA’ LINES. HERE, THE ASSUMPTION IS

THAT THE SHIP IS A BIT OF AN OLDER DESIGN WHICH GETS

REFIT AND THEN EXPANDED UPON AFTER 2271.

THE REGISTRY SCHEME GIVEN BY S7AASHIP DESIGN IS LISTED

AS MUCH HIGHER THAN WHAT’S GIVEN HERE. THAT GUIDE HAS

THE DECATUR AS NCC-2501. THIS IS A BIT HARD TO RATION-

ALIZE WITH THE ‘CONSTELLATION’ AS THE LAST TMP-ERA

DESIGN LAUNCHING WITH NCC-1974, AND THE EXCELSIOR

CLASSES LARGELY TAKING OVER FROM NCC-2000 ONWARD.

THE NUMBERS GIVEN HERE ARE LOWERED TO THE NCC-1780

RANGE, KEEPING THEM A BIT TIGHTER WITH WHAT’S PRE-

SENTED IN S7AA TREK, AS WELL AS HELPING HELPING OUT

THE ROLE OF THE JECA7UA AS A CRUISER IN KIRK’S FLEET.

EDITOR’S ANNOTATIONS

THE SURYAFIRST APPEARED IN ARIDAS SOFIA’S SHIPS OF THE

STARA FLEET, THEN WOULD MAKE MANY APPEARANCES IN

OTHER FAN WORKS, AND WOULD ALSO BE ONE OF THE MOST

POPULAR OF MODEL KITS FOR THE S7AA 7AEK ORIGINAL SE-

RIES ERA. THE REASON MAY BE OBVIOUS, IT’S AN OBVIOUS

‘RETRO-FITTING’ OF THE USS RELIANT FROM THE WRATH OF

KHAN.

THE SURYAWAS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO BE A PRECURSOR

TO THE AEL/ANT, AND SO THAT BACKSTORY WAS LARGELY

USED HERE. THE ONLY ADDITION IS THAT THE SURYA IS NOW A

BIT OLDER, SERVIING MORE AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN THE AWV/70N

CLASS AND WHAT WOULD BECOME THE MIRANDA CLASS.

THE SURYA, AS SHE APPEARS HERE, IS PRETTY MUCH RIGHT

OUT OF THE SHIPS OF THE STAR FLEET DIAGRAMS, WITH ONLY

A FEW DIFFERENCES IN TEXTURING IN THE ‘ENGINEERING’ SEC-

TION TO BRING HER SLIGHTLY MORE IN LINE WITH THE AWV/70ON

AND THE EVENTUAL MIRANDA.

THE SHIP NAMES ARE TAKEN FROM ADRIAS SOFIA’S GUIDE,

THOUGH THE REGISTRIES HAVE BEEN ‘NUDGED’ A BIT CLOSER

TO THE WIRANDA CLASS. ONLY THE FIRST TEN SHIPS ARE

USED, WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE MIRANDA SUR-

PLANTED THE CLASS JUST A BIT EARLY.

OF THIS CLASS SHOULD BE OBVIOUS. OF COURSE, THAT’S NOT MONIKER. IT ALSO ASSUMES THAT THE CLASS IS AN UPGRADE
TO SAY THAT THIS SHIP’S DESIGN WAS EASY TO PIN DOWN. TO THE AWV70ON AND SURYA CLASSES, AS GIVEN IN THEIR
THE MOVIE ITSELF SHOWED THE USS AREL/ANT, OF COURSE, BACKSTORIES.
BUT SAID NOTHING ABOUT ITS CLASS OR OTHER DETAILS.
FANS WERE LEFT TO SPECULATE. FOR THE ORIGINAL SERIES PERIOD, THE SHIP WOULD BE A
MAINSTAY FRIGATE, A PROUD LEAD VESSEL NEARLY ON PAR
PRODUCTION NOTES FROM THE MOVIE LISTED THE SHIP AS A WITH OTHER MAJOR VESSLES OF THE PERIOD. OF COURSE, BY

TO HEART WHEN MAKING THEIR OWN BLUEPRINTS AND OTHER BEEN RELEGATED HEAVILY TO THE BACKGROUND, SERVING

THIS GETS COMPOUNDED BY THE FASA ROLE-PLAYING GAME,
WHICH, IN A FIT OF ORIGINALITY, SIMPLY DUBBED THE CLASS

WERE TWO OFFICIAL NAMES FOR THE CLASS.
NOT TO MAKE THINGS SIMPLER, BUT PERHAPS BE MORE DE-
FINITIVE, THE CLASS WAS OFFICIALLY DUBBED MIRANDA IN

THERE IS THAT IT WAS DECLARED A NEW CLASS OF SHIP FOR
THE WRATH OF KHAN AS WELL. OF COURSE, THIS WOULD
MEAN THAT KHAN WOULDN’T BE FAMILIAR WITH IT, AND IT
CONFLICTS WITH THE SCRIPT AND NOVELIZATION OF THE
MOVIE, WHICH BOTH EXPLICITLY STATE THE SHIP IS AN ‘OLD

THE MACKENZIE APPEARED IN A ‘JAYNEZ SHIPS’ ARTICLE IN BETWEEN THE LATER WIRANOAS AND THE FIRST FEW SOYUZ

STARDATE MAGAZINE. IT WAS ANOTHER ‘FASA-BASH’ MEANT CLASS SHIPS.

FOR USE WITH THAT ROLE-PLAYING GAME. IT WAS AN ORIGI-

NAL SERIES DESIGN, BUT WITH THE COMPONENTS SHOWN, IT

WOULD BE MORE SIZABLE THAN THE EN/7EAPAISE, AND YET IT

WOULD STILL ONLY BE A FRIGATE!

THE VERSION HERE REDRAWS A NUMBER OF THE LINES, AND

USES THE “SMALL COMPONENTS’ FOUND ON THE CAPELLA

AND HELLESPONT. THE SECONDARY HULL LINES REMAIN PRI-

MARILY THE SAME, BUT JUST CLEANED UP A BIT.

THE FASA BACKSTORY SIMPLY DOESN’T WORK FOR S7AA

TREK OF THAT ERA, DESCRIBING A ‘MAQUIS IN REVERSE’, EF-

FECTIVELY, CUSTOM MAKING THESE SHIPS TO PROTECT THEIR

COLONIES. IT’S AN INTERESTING IDEA, BUT AS MANY TIMES AS

KIRK CONFRONTS KLINGONS IN THE YEARS, YOU WOULD THINK

THIS WOULD COME UP SOMETIME.

THE BACKSTORY GIVEN HERE IS SIMPLY BECAUSE THE SHIP
