     Welcome to the second Ship Recognition Manual—the first successor to Volume 1, The Ships of Starfleet, Part 1. As this book’s title
indicates, it focuses on the ships of the Cardassian Union. Of the 30 ships contained herein, most are Cardassian military vessels, but a few
are civilian ships, or ships created by Union member or allied species other than the Cardassians themselves.
     To use this book, you should also have Spacedock: The Advanced Starship Construction and Combat Manual, available as a download


                                                                                                                                                N
from TrekRPG.Net. Otherwise the Starship Templates may prove somewhat confusing. You’ll probably also find it helpful to have the first
SRM, which covers canon Starfleet vessels.
     SRM2: Cardassians includes several ships that previously appeared elsewhere, such as the Galor and Guran classes. Any Starship
Templates in this book supercede those published in earlier volumes. The versions in this book use Cardassian-specific rules and, where


                                                                                                                                                T
necessary, correct errors in the original templates.
     Chapter One, Cardassian Ship Classification, describes how the Cardassians classify their starships. It includes lists of representative
classes of ships for each ship category.
     Chapter Two, Cardassian Ship Construction, provides special rules and guidelines for constructing Cardassian ships. As you’ll see, for
the most part Cardassians build their ships using the ordinary Spacedock rules, but in a few instances (such as hulls, computers, and
navigational deflectors), the rules for their ships differ slightly.
     Chapter Three, The Cardassian Ship Registry, is where you’ll find the meat of this book—the 30 Starship Templates, ranging from the
                                                                                                                                                R

    target enemy ships manually (see Spacedock, pages 91, 109) or
    spend one full round to re-establish all locks.

    This chapter provides Spacedock writeups for over two dozen Cardassian military and civilian ships, plus three ships of species
belonging to the Cardassian Union. These ships supercede earlier Cardassian ship writeups in The Ship Recognition Manual,
Volume 1: The Ships of Starfleet, Part 1 and The Dominion War Sourcebook, since these Starship Templates make use of the
new rules in this book for Cardassian ships and, where necessary, correct errors.

schematics, the Bel’shan-class Cruiser has served the Cardassian
people in many different roles in the past four decades. Created during
a period of expansion and conquest, it was originally built to function
as a planetary and system conquest, patrol, and suppression vessel—in
short, to perform primarily short-range missions. Over the years its role
expanded to fill many other niches, including some longer-range patrol,
scouting, and support missions. Although not as sophisticated as many
newer ships, it continues to perform efficiently and well in many
different situations.
     In 2371 the class underwent general upgrades. It received larger,
better, and/or newer impulse engines, medical systems,
communications systems, and computer subroutines. Other planned
class upgrades were halted when the conflict with the Klingons broke
out.
     The Bel’shan clearly displays the Cardassian ship design principles
                                                                                                                                                       c

     Description and Notes
C    Fleet data:
           The Guran is one of the oddest-looking ships fielded by the Central
L    Command. Its main body closely resembles the Aberax-class Destroyer,
     but an enormous U-shaped superstructure attaches ventrally to the
     command hull, pointing forward. Long structures shaped like flattened
A    cylinders attach to each side of the U; they can hold weapons, supplies,
     additional crew quarters, or the like.

S          During the Dominion War, the Central Command used Guran-class
     ships much like Hideki-class Scouts—to harass enemy capital ships whe
     n in large wings, and to oppose enemy ships like itself on a one-on-

S    one basis. Although not as heavily armed as the Jem’Hadar Fast Attack
     Ship, it achieved almost as good a record during the war due to the
     skills of the Central Command’s pilots and crew.

     Noteworthy vessels/service records/encounters:
         Guran, prototype; Eth’gar, beamed first enemy troops onto Betazed
     (2374); Kordat, destroyed three Klingon Brakt-class Fast Attack ships
     while defending the Chin’toka system (2375).

Description and Notes
Fleet data:
    Although nowhere near as numerous as the Galor-class Battle
Cruiser, the Kalen-class vessel is a common sight among the fleets of
the Central Command—in fact, some officers refer to it as fen’aras, the
“younger brother” of the Galor. Hundreds of Kalens patrol the
spacelanes and systems of the Cardassian Union, detering invasions
and enforcing the law.
     During the Dominion War, Kalen wings played a decisive role in
many battles, including much of the Kalandra Campaign. Federation
alliance ships soon learned to fear its firepower and maneuverability.
Though slower than the Galor, what the Kalen lacks in speed it makes
up for in its ability to turn and accelerate quicker than the larger Battle
Cruiser. Wings composed of Galors (for offensive power) and Kalens
(for maneuvering and defense against enemy fighters) were an
important component of many Dominion-Cardassian strike fleets.
     The Central Command has accused its Starship Engineering
Division of patterning the appearance of the Kalen on the rengat, a
crustacean native to the seas of Cardassia Prime. Its central hull,
shaped like a crescent with the points aft, has a deep notch in the cent                                                                                 c

Description and Notes
Fleet data:

     In service since 2355, the the Nuras-class Heavy Scout differs from
most Cardassian ships in some important respects. As a scout, it has t
o be fast and maneuverable, and for that reason its designers avoided
                                                                            L
the standard embedded-nacelle feature found in most Cardassian
vessels. Instead, they placed the warp nacelles—which have a sort of
elongated half-oval shape that looks nothing like Starfleet or Romulan
                                                                            A
nacelles—on two pylons projecting backward from a slender, tapered
engineering hull connected to an arrowhead-shaped primary hull. The
end result is a ship that vaguely resembles a dart or arrow, but which
                                                                            S
looks nothing like most other Cardassian vessels.
     In the twenty years since it first entered the fleet, the Nuras has
                                                                            S
proven itself well-suited for even the most dangerous scouting missions
. Its speed, agility, ability to enter atmospheres, powerful shields, and
heavy armament (for a ship its size) make it perfect for recon missions
behind enemy lines, or forays into uncharted and potentially hazardous
systems. Since 2363, the Central Command has installed an improved
sensor suite in all Nuras-class ships, to enhance their ability to gather
information.

Noteworthy vessels/service records/encounters:
     Nuras, prototype; Ortetha, performed reconnaissance mission that
uncovered a weakness in Starfleet’s lines which the Central Command
exploited in the attack on Hugara V (2363); Trin’ga, captured by
Starfleet while spying in Federation space, causing a major diplomatic
incident (2369); Kend’dhar, gathered information which made possible
the conquest of Benzar (2374).

a large, elongated command hull (with an aft dorsal bridge module), an

                                                                            O
almost equally as broad engineering hull, and two large pylon-like
superstructures, one rising dorsally above the ship from a point about
two-thirds of the way aft down the engineering hull, and a shorter twin
that projects ventrally. Both superstructures terminate in fat crescent-
shaped weapons modules.
     The Sholec’s unusual profile was dictated by its primary combat
                                                                            L
role— that of a carrier for Hideki-class Fighters. Designed at the same
time as the Hideki, the Sholec’s command hull contains three fighter
bays along both its port and starboard edges, each large enough to
                                                                            E
accomodate the Size 3 Hideki. The landing bays feed into a large
central repair and maintenance bay. Once repaired and outfitted, fighters
can leave the ship through one of four launching bays (two directly
                                                                            C
forward, one forward dorsal, one forward ventral). The two weapons
modules provide widespread fire to cover the fighters as they enter and
exit the ship. The dorsal module also contains an auxiliary control room
for the ship.
     As one might expect from a ship its size, the Sholec mounts some
                                                                            C
powerful weapons. Its main disruptors are Class Ul’khar, with Drevans
and Jhokhels as its “lesser” weapons. It also carries several torpedo
launchers, more than most Cardassian ships do. On the other hand, its
                                                                            L
size and structure hamper its maneuverability somewhat; Cardassian
officers refer to the ship as the Huraksha, or “Waddler.”                   A
Noteworthy vessels/service records/encounters:
     Sholec, prototype; Gher’laat, spearheaded successful Cardassian
offensive to recapture the Brentak system from the Klingons (2373);

S    Description and Notes
H    Fleet data:
          The Sho’vash-class Medical vessel serves as the standard “flying
     hospital” of the Central Command. Equipped to deal with epidemics,
     combat injuries, the aftermaths of natural disasters, and any other event
     which affects the health or physical well-being of the Cardassian

C
     people, it has accomodations ranging from luxurious (for those with
     high vesala) to barely adequate (for the least influential Cardassians).
          The main body of the Sho’vash consists of a fat crescent-shaped

L    command hull (with a shallow forward notch) and an elongated,
     tapering engineering hull not markedly different from that on a Galor-
     or Keldon-class vessel. However, attached to all four sides of the

A    engineering hull are several “medical hulls,” similar in shape to the
     command hull, but smaller and equipped for medical purposes. A
     typical Sho’vash has three medical hulls dorsal and two on each of its

S    other three sides, but some variants have more or fewer hulls.

     Noteworthy vessels/service records/encounters:
S        Sho’vash, prototype; Gormala, saved the inhabitants of Droken IV
     from a Visterian fever plague (2362); Trenat, rescued and healed the
     survivors of the Klingon-perpetrated massacre at Vendrosa Secundus
     (2373).

Fleet data:
    The Sulor-class Escort is the most commonly-used Escort vessel in
the Cardassian fleet. Swift and reasonably well-armed, it performs any    L
                                                                          A
sort of escort mission well, and with its advanced sensor systems, it
can also function as a scout or science vessel if necessary. The Sixth
and Ninth Orders have adapted many Sulors for exploration duties.
    Physically, the Sulor seems to resemble a Ferengi or Klingon vessel
as much as a Cardassian one. The central part of the body projects
forward and aft, with the bridge and a weapons array forward and the
                                                                          S
impulse engines aft. A fat crescent-shaped central structure, with the
points of the crescent forward, holds the embedded nacelles, the warp
core, several weapons, and most of the crew quarters.
                                                                          S
Noteworthy vessels/service records/encounters:
     Sulor, prototype; Khal’haz, protected vital supply convoy from a
Klingon attack (2372); Loderren, detected a Federation alliance ambush
in time to save a wing of couriers from almost certain capture (2375).

     Description and Notes
     Fleet data:
            The Starship Engineering Division designed the Thalkar-class Heavy
c    Frigate to fulfill several primary mission profiles. First and foremost
o    among these was planetary defense/suppression and system patrol. For
n    this reason, the ship has heavy shields and strong sensors. Second, it
     was to provide escort services to large capital vessels, such as the
t    Keldon and Sholec classes. Thus, the designers gave it fairly powerful
i    engines and the ability to maneuver.
n           During the Dominion War, the Central Command used Thalkars to
     fill less important sections of fleet formations, or to act as support and
u    reinforcements for Destroyers, Cruisers, and Warships. Federation
e    alliance forces destroyed or crippled many ships of this class during the
     final months of the war, when ships the Dominion initially held back got

     Description and Notes
c    Fleet data:
o          The Vidren-class Strike Frigate began as a gleam in the eye of
     Glinn Hotar Peret, who worked on the Thalkar Development Project but
n    left it after two years, when he developed serious differences of opinion
t    with his superiors. Glinn Peret wanted a ship of roughly the same size,
i    but very different configuration. The ship he envisioned, which he
     christened a “Strike Frigate,” would have heavy armament and shields,
n    but remain as fast and maneuverable as lesser frigates. When it
u    became apparent to him that the officers in charge of the project were
     jealous of his genius and would not listen to his ideas, he used his
e    vesala to arrange a transfer to another project, to develop an as-yet-
d    unnamed new type of frigate. There, his ideas proved more influential.

used by the Cardassians, consists of four sections. The primary section,
the command hull, is a large half-oval shape similar to that seen on

                                                                             R
many other Cardassian ships. Attached to it aft center is a rectangular
engineering hull, similar in shape to engineering hulls on other
Cardassian vessels, but much shorter and taller. Attached to the dorsal
and ventral sides of the engineering hull are fat crescent-shaped
“laboratory pods” containing advanced sensors and scientific equipment,
and attached to its aft side is a long “tail” of six sections. Each of
                                                                             E
these sections holds more laboratories and science facilities, and is
modular; the crew can swap a section out at a spacedock and put a
section with different labs and equipment in its place.
                                                                             S
     Although well-equipped for scientific pursuits, the Voreska is a poor
combat vessel by Cardassian standards. Equipped only with a few
disruptor arrays, and one forward torpedo launcher, it’s weakly armed
                                                                             K

THE CARDASSIAN UNION

P    Description and Notes
     Fleet data:

R
           Cardassian efficiency in matters penological is legendary (some might
     say “infamous”) throughout the Alpha Quadrant. The Prendak-class Prison
     Transport provides a prime example of that efficiency. Built to transport up

E
     to 2,500 hardened criminals (each in his own cell, to prevent fraternization)
     with absolute security, it does its job quite well.
           The internal security of a Prendak presents a nigh-insurmountable

N    obstacle to transportees’ escape plans (the only recorded successful
     escapes from a Prendak have all involved corruption on the part of the
     jailers, or outside assistance). All security officers have extensive training, and

D    are well-armed with energy weapons that function only for themselves;
     criminals find them useless if they manage to obtain one. They also carry
     prison tricorders optimized to scan for contraband and the like. Every three-

A    meter section of corridor or access tube can be sealed by powerful
     neutralization fields, and at the least sign of resistance or attempted escape
     by prisoners, the captain won’t hesitate to flood selected sections with

K    neurozine (an anaesthetic gas) or neurocine (a lethal gas). Unfortunate
     misunderstandings of the captain’s order for the anaesthetic have led to the
     deaths of hundreds of inmates on several of these ships, but the Ministry of
     Justice chalks these events up to the nature of the work, shrugs its
     shoulders, and makes no changes in nomenclature or procedure.
