# Orion Piracy

For most of Earthís star-faring history, the Orion
Pirates had been a major thorn in their side. While
the Orion government officially declared neutrality throughout this time,
the raids had stepped up both in their boldness and in their cost in lives
and Federation property. 


The loss of Federation vessels, both civilian and
the UESPA fleet, but the Orionís official denial of
involvement kept any major act of retaliation at
bay. Even the attack on the Babel Conference in
2267 did not meet with due response (largely
because the attack was a decisive failure).


In 2269, a Federation transport, the USS Huron, was raided by the Orion Pirates. 
This may have gone as just another dilithium raid, but the ship
was also carrying much needed strobilin medicine. 
Though the USS Enterprise was able to capture the Orion pirates responsible 
and reclaim the strobilin, the several days delay in its delivery had
caused thousands of innocent deaths. The Orion
Consortium had again claimed this as an act of
ëcriminalsí and declared its neutrality. 
This time, however, the Federation had had enough.


For generations, the Federation Council had resisted the 
use of strong force against a minor
power such as the Orions, but it was clear that
decisive action was needed. The Vulcan ambassador, Sarek, 
himself declared that the Federation
would need to act to safeguard the lives of its
people, a 'swing' vote that made action final.


In 2271, just as the Constitution era was coming
to a close, three battle groups were taken from
the Klingon border with the express purpose of
eliminating the Orion coloniesí space-faring capability, 
bypassing the pirate fleet and attacking starbases and spaceports directly. 
The massive use of force was lead by the 
Federation 'Dreadnoughts' the USS Federation and USS Entente.


Though some Federation vessels were lost, the
result of the conflict was decisive. Within a week, 
all starbases and support systems within the
Orion Colonies were destroyed, as well as over
ninety percent of their fleet. The Orion government was 
disbanded with most of its members
arrested and tried with various Crimes Against the Galaxy.

With the end of the Orion Government in 2271,
the Orion Piracy threat was all but completely
eliminated. The criminal groups which remained would 
continue their operations through the 24th century, 
but never again with the power and capability that they had enjoyed a century before.
