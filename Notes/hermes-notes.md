# Hermes Class

The _Hermes_ class may be a model exercise in optimism, designed more to placate certain member
worlds of the federation. With the ëConstitution
projectí seen as too militaristic, Star Fleet was ordered to create a dedicated explorer with the
newest technologies to fufill as purely 'scientific
exploration role'. The result was the somewhat ill-conceived Hermes class.


Though the _Hermes_ class boasts impressive sensor capabilities for her time, their light armament
and problematic use of a single PB-32 engine left their extremely vulnerable in the field. 
While effective at stellar cartography and scientific work, 
several Hermes class ships were lost early in their career, causing Star Fleet to rethink their use.


The remaining scouts serve largely within larger
task forces or in 'safe zones', resigned largely to
scientific work or acting as lead 'scouts' with other, more hardy ships providing escort.


The Hermes class was declared 'complete' in 2259, and replaced by a variety of other designs. 
Despite the hardships, the class was given a second lease
on life once the upgraded Hermes (refit) class, which would remove the SB-32 flaw.


## Editor's Annotations

The _Hermes_ first appeared in the Franz Joseph
technical manual and was envisioned as a 'scout
class' ship. She had the same primary hull and warp
engines as the Constitution class, but was barely
armed, The visual representation from the Technical Manual, used many times in other fan-based
works, is the one used here.

Despite its familiarity with the fans, this is one of
those ships that Gene Rodenberry declared 'non- canon' back in the days of The Motion Picture. The
use of a single warp engineí was cited as ëproofí that the ship could not actually exist. This flies in
the face that the USS Revere is mentioned by name, type, and registry in the motion picture, and her
schematics shown on screen as well.

This guide uses only the first 'batch' from the
Techcnial manual as members of the Hermes class, and assumes that, 
for whatever reason, the SB-32 has problems when used as a single engine configuration


Admittedly, this guide is a little tough on the Hermes, but it's hard to reconcile this ship going out
onto the frontier while barely armed, under-powered, and only having a really good sensor
suite to its advantage. It doesn't seem like this is
the type of ship we would expect to see much
exploring the hazardous frontier where even the
Enterprise is under near-constant threat.
