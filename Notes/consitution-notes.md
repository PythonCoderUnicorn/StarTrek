# Consititution Notes

The Constitution class was launched in 2245 as a
'new generation' Starfleet workhorse to replace
the aging Baton Rouge class of ships. Where the
Baton Rouge would represent the pinnacle of
Earth design, the Constitution would represent
the pride of the entire Federation itself. Technical
innovations from several Federation worlds
would take the steps laid down by the Baton
Rouge, refine them, and then create the greatest
starship devised by any world in the Federationóa
legend which would strike awe in those who see
the vessels even a hundred years late.


The Constitution class would continue as the
UESPA's and then the Federationís premiere starship class during one of the most tumultuous periods of Federation history. The USS Enterprise alone, under her legendary captains April, Pike, and Kirk, would, would go on to legendary status for innu- merable acts of bravery in the field, multiple first-contact assignments, as well as saving the very core of the Federation itself.


Even with four major refit programs over her
twenty-five year run, the original configuration of
the Constitutiuon and her sisters proved dated by
the late 2260's. Rather than wholly scrap the class, however, 
the surviving vessels would enjoy a radical, complete refit and rebuild starting in 2271.
