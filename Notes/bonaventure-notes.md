# Bonaventure Class

In the 2230's, scientists that were continuing ex- periments with crystal-focused energy 
often considered the implications for a crystal-focused
warp system. The idea was to channel the massive energies of anti-matter annihilation into a
stable focus, provided that there was a crystal matrix that could actually do the job.

In 2233, Dr. Wendell Herzog began using dilithium crystals on Rigel as a focus for his anti-matter
experiments. The results were more than promising. The crystal proved a durable focus even under
the intense pressures of anti-matter annihilations. This discovery was a breakthrough in both the
amount of energy which could be harnessed, as well as the efficiency and safety levels of anti-matter usage.

In 2234, this theory was given the ultimate test. A
new warp engine design would begin trial runs
based on Doctor Herzog's theories. The PB-32 Prototype design was completed in six months (using
concepts already planned for the Baton Rouge's successor) and, in the Spring of 2235, the USS
Bonaventure was launched.


The demands on the Bonaventure would be measured in safe, careful, baby-steps. 
The first six-month tour would be little more than a basic testing of
stresses and endurance on the new warp system. In wouldn't be until 2237 that the ship would be
pressed to the limit, reaching the record of warp
seven set by the Baton Rouge class, but doing so
with much less strain on the drive and ship.


The sister ship, the Bonne Chance, would top this
record the same year, reaching a sustainable warp
eight. This performance would so impress the
UESPA that orders were immediately drawn up for
a new, 'hardened' form of the PB-32 engine would
be used for the next generation of starships. These
engines would be a defining feature of the Constitution era of starship design.


Though a breakthrough in warp dynamics, the
Bonaventure design would be decidedly lackluster
in other areas. The two ships of the class would be
given to minor survey duties once the USS Constiutiton was launched as the fleet's mainstay vessel. 
The Bonaventure herself was lost in a temporal
anomaly, and no other ships of her type would be built afterwards.


## Editor's Notes

If there's any ship that discredit's the place of the
Animated Series in official Star Trek 'canon', this
would be it. According to Scotty, the Bonaventure
is the first ship with Warp Drive. Of course, this is
problematic in several ways, even ignoring the retconning found in First Contact.


For the purposes of this guide, the ship is the first
one with a dilithium drive, making it the scientific
leap over the Baton Rouge period, and breaking
in the formation of the Star Trek universe as we know it.


The actual design of the ship is more-or-less
what's seen on screen. The origin of the design
quickly becomes obvious, though. The Bonaventure is little more 
than the Enterprise, traced over, with new bits add, and with the windows
enlarged. It worked well enough, though the
Bonaventure looks a bit awkward as a result. (The fins do nothing to help the look, either.)


The starship's registry was decidedly strange in
the Animated Series, and has been changed here
to reflect the current 'canon' view of registries, as
well as have a number more in keeping with the
fleet's numbers at the time.
