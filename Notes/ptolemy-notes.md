# Ptolemy Class 

The design of the _Ptolemy_ was meant as a heavy
delivery system for Starfleetís ëgeneric transport
podí system. The design allows for a transport
pod to be locked into place beneath the primary
hull, allowing, in theory, for the _Ptolemy_ to serve
either as a simple transport ship, or also perform
other functions depending on how she was outfitted.

The shipí's performance can vary widely depending on the pod used, ranging from near defenseless with a simple transport to near cruiser capabilities with a heavy combat pod system. The downside of this flexability, however, is that the specs of each arrangement tend to be somewhat less than a dedicated ship.

In addition to the pod system, the Ptolemy's powerful tractor beam array (located within and behind
the connection strut) can be used as a regular tug, enabling the Ptolemy to come to the aid of even
the largest starships ,and even smaller outposts and bases, and return wounded craft back for full repairs.


The performance of the vessel can change dramatically depending on the pod that it may be carrying, and the pods themselves vary from simple bulk freight to more military-specific systems.


## Editor's Annotations

The Ptolemy first appeared in Franz Josephís Technical Manual, 
and was meant to be the Federation's mainstay supply and support ship. 
The Transport wasn't so much designed to tow other ships, but instead make use of a 
number of 'Transport pods' that could ship large volumes of bulk goods, 
or even serve as a star-liner for passengers.

Despite its familiarity with the fans, this is one of
those ships that Gene Rodenberry declared 'non-canon' back in the days of The Motion Picture. 
For the Ptolemy, the supposed objection to the
design was that the warp engines did not have
full line of sight on one another. Of course, if
thatís a problem, the on-screen _SS Aurora_ or _USS Grissom_ would be problems as well. 
Topping all of this off, though, is that the ship's schematics appear in three of the feature films.


This guide uses only most of the first 'batch' from
the Technical Manual as members of the
Ptolemy class, stripping down its numbers to
something more reasonable. The registration
numbers have also been altered (largely just
dropping the initial '3' from each) to bring the
design In line with the rest of fleetís registries.


The 'NAR' ships, or auxiliary reserves, are named
after contemporary Chinese support vessels of
various types. The ëgeneral useí transports are
named after contemporary polish freighters.
