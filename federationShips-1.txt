   At the height of the war with the Dominion, Starfleet shipyards throughout the Federation were a flurry of activity as engineers
raced to field vessels under construction, some of them only partially completed. Designs that were originally intended for peaceful
exploration purposes were ruggedized and adapted for the realities of a combat heavy environment. Two classes recently fielded, the
Majestic and Frontier were early contenders for adaptation to this new standard and were immediately rushed into construction in a
militarized form. The end results were the Kitty Hawk and Bismark-class starships.

Classification: With her design emphasis on fleet operations and local area dominance, the Bismarck is classified as a battleship.

Design: The Bismarck is basically a reengineered, new incarnation of the Galaxy hull form. The Bismarck-class modification of the
Galaxy-class spaceframe is intended to give the vessel greater endurance in extended missions, and the main differences are in the use
of internal space. The Bismarck devotes more internal area to ships stores, converting unused space into cargo areas and crew quarters.
Some of these modifications resulted in the repositioning of certain shipboard systems and an altered weapons array. The sum total of
all modifications resulted in a slight increase in displacement over the standard Galaxy-class vessels while keeping the Bismarcks
lighter than the Mythe-class battlecruiser variant.

Engineering: The Frontier was among the first vessels designed with the FIUWR-1 (Federation Improved Warp type R/1) warp drive
from Shuvinaaljis Warp Technologies of Vulcan, and the Bismarcks has retained this power scheme. Coupled with the proven FIG-3
impulse drive, the Bismarck is a powerful and maneuverable foe at both warp speed and subliminal velocities.

Tactical: The tactical and damage control innovations found on the Bismarck-class are among the most advanced in the fleet, and
easily rival those found in the Mythe-class battlecruiser. One of the strengths of the Frontier is her ability to provide heavy sustained
firepower at great distances. This ability is due in thanks to the new long range FH-10A phaser system from MinTech Armaments.
The Frontier also sports a modified version of the venerable FP-10 torpedo launch system, which has a 20% greater launch capacity
per torpedo spread. The Bismarck also retains the Frontier-class’ unique FQ-1 quantum torpedo launcher in a retracting bay in place
of the captain’s yacht. Able to track targets through a full 300° range of motion, the FQ-1 adds a sizeable kick to the Bismarck’s
power projection capability. These weapon systems, coupled with the incorporation of abalative armor into the hull, and the heavy
FSW-2 deflector shield system, make the Frontier-class a deadly foe in combat.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The Bismarck-class vessels are some of the most manpower intensive ships ever fielded by
Starfleet and are crowded by any standard. Crew support facilities are extensive though crowded, and the few holodecks available
aboard ship are booked weeks in advance. Sector command battlestaffs and flag officers know the Bismarck’s for their no-nonsense
approach to life in space and are popular assignments nonetheless. The computer systems aboard the four vessels of the class are a
mixture of bio-neural/isolinear circuitry in a traditional triple redundant EM hardened configuration. The Bismark-class ships also
mount the innovative Emergency Holographic Anti-incursion program, designed to counter boarding attempts and for rapid internal
security response. The EHA is also tied to the EMH for ship wide supplemental medical services. These systems have been modified
to cover nearly 80% of the vessel’s internal volume.

Development and Construction History: The Bismarck-class is produced at the Utopia Planitia Shipyards at the rate of one unit per
year. All remain in active service. The vessels are all named for famous battleships of the Terran Second World War, one for each of
the major powers involved.

   The loss of 39 starships in a single day to the Borg on stardate 4/6701 placed Starfleet Operations in crisis mode. Their ability to
ward off further attacks by this seemingly unstoppable foe or any other push against the Federation was in serious doubt, and the fleet
needed to replace their losses as soon as possible. In the initial batch of ideas was a plan to refurbish and reactivate five virtually
antique Federation-class dreadnoughts, a vessel type that had last seen service nearly three decades before. It was a controversial
decision with detractors fearful that these elderly fleet workhorses were so obsolete that to even consider taking them into battle was
tantamount to premeditated murder. Regardless of their critics, the first reactivated hulls of the class entered service in August of
2367 and quickly became the standard-bearer for Starfleet’s efforts to mollify a public still reeling from the losses of just a few months
before.

Classification: Although she now serves with the fleet in a manner more akin to a light cruiser, the term dreadnought has been
retained for the Federation-class for reasons that are more nostalgic than practical.

Design: For the most part, the Federation-class retains the same look that it adopted after the Mk II and III refits of the 2270s and
2290s.

Engineering: Like several of the older starship classes that reentered service following the Borg invasion of 2367 and during the
Dominion War, the Federation employs the FUWE-1 warp drive, a lightweight and dependable powerplant with a track record for
dependability that has since proven to be phenomenal. When the reactivated dreadnoughts were pulled form the line in 2370 and refit
to Mk IV specifications, engineers were surprised to find that the new warp drive had increased the vessels maximum emergency
speed to warp 9.95, a mark far above what computer modeling had predicted. Furthermore, by utilizing warp field load balancing
among the three nacelles and variable field layering techniques previously unavailable to the class, the Federation was able to
maintain that top speed for nearly 40 hours, a threefold increase over previous incarnation of the class. Impulse power as provided by
the single mounted FIG-3 drive helped improve the class’ handling at sublight velocities.

Tactical: Previous incarnations of the Federation utilized a heavy array of FH-11 phasers, and they were retained virtually as-is for
the Mk IV. The largest change to the tactical systems came in the mounting of a single forward mounted FP-110 torpedo launcher
capable of laying down a spread of five torpedoes at once and the upgraded FSS-M shield generator. Hardware revisions and
software upgrades for the vessel’s structural integrity system along with the addition of several hull-framing reinforcements in the
engineering hull helped nearly double the Federations already impressive superstructure rating. New sensors and intelligence
gathering “black boxes” replaced antiquated systems in the lower saucer’s equipment bay, though their inclusion necessitated a costly
power distribution system upgrade and expansion of the optical data network bandwidth to handle the increased information
processing requirements. In all, the refits of the early 2370s helped bring the class into its own as a modern fighting vessel.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: From their reactivation in 2367 until they completed their refit cycle in the early 2370s, the
reactivated Federations were unpopular assignments for their crews. The shipboard crew facilities were a far cry from what they had
come to expect from some of the more modern vessels in service, and in the rush to get them into the field little thought had gone into
making their crews comfortable. However, the refits brought the inclusion of new holodecks, modern recreational facilities and a
measure of automation that helped ease the crowding problem that had always plagued the class. This later issue came about by the
complete removal of the Federation’s outmoded (and some would say quaint) duotronic computer core and replacing it with an
isolinear type that had been developed for the Steamrunner-class destroyers.

Development and Construction History: Of the five Federation-class vessels pulled from mothballs or public display in 2367, all
remain in active service. Amazingly, although some of these vessels will soon celebrate the 130th anniversary of their commissioning,
there are no plans to remove them from service in the near future.

   At the height of the war with the Dominion, Starfleet shipyards throughout the Federation were a flurry of activity as engineers
raced to field vessels under construction, some of them only partially completed. Designs that were originally intended for peaceful
exploration purposes were ruggedized and adapted for the realities of a combat heavy environment. Two classes recently fielded, the
Majestic and Frontier were early contenders for adaptation to this new standard and were immediately rushed into construction in a
militarized form. The end results were the Kitty Hawk and Bismark-class starships.

Classification: Reluctantly, Starfleet chose to designate the Kitty Hawk as a dreadnought, the first such designation in over a century.

Design: The Kitty Hawk is a cut down and reengineered Galaxy hull form. The engineering section is virtually identical to the
Galaxy with minor changes to its internal arrangement. The connecting dorsal joining the engineering section and saucer was all but
removed and the two were mated directly without a provision for separation. Additionally, the saucer was also reoriented 90° with the
internal spaces and external features altered accordingly. The orientation of the saucer is not so much an aesthetic choice, but is an
attempt to decrease the fore and aft target aspect. With the removal of the saucer separation connects and related equipment, the loss
of the connecting dorsal is barely noticeable. In fact, internal habitable volume is only 2% less than the Galaxy-class.

Engineering: The Kitty Hawk was among the first vessels designed with the FIUWR-1 (Federation Improved Warp type R/1) warp
drive from Shuvinaaljis Warp Technologies of Vulcan. Coupled with the proven FIG-4 impulse drive, the Kitty Hawk is a powerful
foe at both warp speed and subluminal velocities.

Tactical: One of the strengths of the Kitty Hawk is her ability to provide sustained firepower at great distances. This ability is due in
thanks to the new long range FH-16 phaser system from HiBeam Energies. Coupled with the proven FP-10 torpedo launch system in
a fore/aft arrangement, the Kitty Hawk is a formidable adversary. Like the Majestic-class, the Kitty Hawk employs a rotating FQ-1
quantum torpedo launcher along with it’s devastating 300° field of fire. The Kitty Hawk is further fit with the most modern CIC
(Command and Control) suite yet devised and can and coordinate the movements of an entire sector if need be. Although she rarely
operates with a full Marine contingent, the class has the unique ability to deliver an entire Marine regiment on a target not only by
transporter, but by flights of “Hopper” combat landing craft. Equipment for this purpose is held in several of the vessel’s massive
cargo bays and maintained for immediate use.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The Kitty Hawk–class sports the most up to date tactical sensors and communications suite in
the fleet. The computer systems aboard the four vessels of the class are a mixture of bio-neural/isolinear circuitry in a traditional triple
redundant and EM-Radiation hardened configuration. The EMH system has been further modified to cover nearly 70% of the vessel’s
internal volume with backups located in the emergency triage and evacuation stations.

Development and Construction History: The Kitty Hawk-class is produced at Sol IV shipyards from 2375-2385 with five units
constructed in all. Upon cessation of hostilities with the Dominion, construction stalled for nearly two years with building resuming ,
at a slower rate. All remain in active service.

   The Ambassador-class project has spanned nearly fifty years, and stands testament to her designer's foresight. Conceived as a long
range explorer and instrument of Federation policy, the Ambassadors remains a integral part of Starfleet to this day. The design is
also one of the most improved upon in history. In the mid-2350s, in response to hostilities taking place with the Cardassians, Starfleet
sought to modify the Ambassador design. Her tactical support systems and sustainable high warp velocities insures that the
Springfield–class can show the flag of the Federation at a moments notice just like the dreadnoughts of old.

Classification: The Springfield is classified as a dreadnought, a designation that denotes an emphasis on tactical support missions,
fleet command facilities, and power projection capabilities.

Design: The Springfield’s basic design is an almost straight copy of the Ambassador-class. However, the addition of the third nacelle
along the dorsal spine necessitated an almost total redesign of the vessel’s internal arrangement. The third nacelle on the dorsal spine
contains specialized Dynamic Warp Field Overlay Projectors (DWFOP) to allow the vessel to operate on just two or even one nacelle
in an emergency situation.

Engineering: The FIUWA-1 warp drive fit on the Springfield is an improved version of the type mounted aboard the Ambassador.
Contrary to popular belief, the third nacelle does not allow the Springfield to go any faster than any other starship of comparable
displacement. Instead, it allows the Springfield to maintain high warp speeds for longer periods of time. By dividing the propulsive
forces among the three nacelles, the warp core tolerances are much greater and allow for longer high-speed sprints. With a normal
cruising speed of warp six or a maximum sustainable warp speed of 9.6 for 36 hours, the Springfield is usually the first vessel to
respond to a crisis. Early production units of the Springfield suffered from poor sublight maneuverability and micro-crystaline
fracturing along the central nacelle pylon, but these problems were quickly resolved. By added additional spacetime driver coils to the
impulse emitters, the relative mass of the Springfield was lowered allowing the FIH-2 fusion reactors to provide adequate
maneuverability at sublight speeds.




                                                                  13

Tactical: The Springfield benefited greatly from the tactical advancements coming out of the Galaxy-class Development Project.
While the FH-11 phaser system from HiBeam Energies has been a standard for many years, the FP-10 torpedo launchers provide a
flexible offensive and defensive punch to the Springfield. The inclusion of a full Combat Information Center (CIC) and 500 man
Marine detachment allows the vessels of the class to respond to nearly any situation called upon them.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: Thanks to the addition of the machinery for the third warp nacelle, a full CIC suite and Marine
compliment, the Springfield is a no frills design. Like most vessels with her mission profile, the Springfield is crowded and bustles
with activity at all hours. These vessels are commonly used for border patrols and task force operation workups, though their
exploration capability is rudimentary at best due to a decreased cruising range and combat oriented sensor suite. An enhanced
isolinear triple redundant computer system is standard to the Springfield class with extra processor resources allocated to engineering
functions due to the complex warp field dynamics created by the third nacelle.

Development and Construction History: The Springfield was designed and initially constructed at the Utopia Planitia Fleet Yards at
Mars. Of the 23 units built, 15 remain in active service. One, the USS Chekov, was lost to the Borg at the Battle of Wolf 359. The

The USS Brisbane sparked a three week search by several fellow Starfleet vessels after she failed to report in on stardate 4/7901. The
vessel has been patrolling near Tholian space when she reportedly fell into an uncharted wormhole. The Brisbane was thrown nearly
the length of the Federation and wound up several days journey beyond her borders. With her comm array a pile of melted junk and
damage limiting the vessel to warp 4, the battered starship limped into range of a listening outpost after several weeks of traveling at
best speed. The Brisbane was taken to Starbase 42, refit and pressed back into service.

On stardate 4/8008.17 the USS Brisbane continued its string of bad luck while patrolling near Rigel IV along with the starships
Gulliver and Invicta. While preforming a standard commerce sweep, the group was caught in a catastrophic ion storm. Initially, the
Gulliver became caught in the storm’s wavefront and lost main power. The Brisbane moved into transporter range and attempted to
beam off the stricken destroyer’s crew. Instead, the Brisbane was soon without power and both vessels were forced to abandon ship.
With the Invicta standing by to take on survivors, the two starships were torn apart within minutes by the powerful storm. In the end,
only 14 crewmen were picked up from the Guliver along with 233 from the Brisbane.

While patrolling the Vulcan Front during the Dominion war in 2373, the USS Dumas, leading the Andromeda-class USS Centauri
and Heimdall-class USS Yale, reported enemy vessels closing on their position. Outnumbered and outmatched, the Federation force
fled for a nearby asteroid cluster to try to lose their pursuers. Cardassian after action reports obtained at the war’s conclusion show
that the Galor-class cruiser Kalkar observed the starships enter the field, disappear from view and never reemerged. No shots were
fired and no wreckage was ever found. Subsequent searches of the same field yielded no further clues and no new evidence has
surfaced in the years since. The Federation has since classified the vessels as lost, presumed destroyed.

   By 2360, the last of the Normandy-class dreadnoughts had been relegated to the starship retirement depot at Memory Beta, the last
stop for vessels considered obsolete or past their useful design lifetime. At the time, the Normandys were considered too slow and
vulnerable for modern operations, and their usefulness as a Military Operations heavy support ship was a thing of the past.
Unfortunately, heavy losses to the Borg at Wolf 359 had placed Starfleet Command into a crisis mode, and the twelve most viable
vessels of the Normandy-class were quickly placed back into service until the losses could be replaced. Over the next decade, the
class would receive a number of upgrades that would bring them up to modern specifications, though no amount of effort could hold
back the inevitable and final decision to retire them permanently.
   Though the Normandy-class is no longer in service, they are included here as an homage to their long decades of valuable service to
the Federation.

Classification: Then they were first introduced, the Normandy was designated as a dreadnought, a classification that denotes her
heavy firepower, slower top speed and ability to carry Marines. During the 2367 reactivations, the term dreadnought was retained,
although at that point their role was more akin to a light cruiser.

Design: The technology for the Normandy was developed during and borrowed heavily from the Excelsior-class of the late 2290s.
The saucer section is a direct copy of the Excelsior’s, though her secondary hull is a unique design.



                                                                 16

Engineering: Upon their reactivation following the Battle of Wolf 359, it was quickly discovered that the old powerplants of the
class were going to need some serious attention if Starfleet intended to keep then active for the next decade. Starting with the USS
Vincennes in 2368, three or four Normandy’s per year were withdrawn from service for a comprehensive refit. This included massive
upgrades to her warp drive that brought her emergency top speed to a respectable warp 9.45.

Tactical: Tactical upgrades to the class were largely unnecessary, as the Normandys had never suffered from a lack of respectable
firepower. However, Starfleet Tactical insisted on at least replacing the older FP-4 torpedo system with the more modern FP-10. In
the end, only the forward facing tubes were refit, and the class would spend the rest of their lifespan with a mix of FP-4 and FP-10
weaponry. The greatest and most welcome change to come to the Normandy during these refits was the complete replacement of her
antique FSS-1 shield generators with the ultra-modern FSS-M. This more than anything rejuvenated the class as a whole and made
her acceptable for operations during the Dominion War. In 2373, in response to the need for a heavily armed troop carrier, the Kidd,
Juneau, Hammann and Lejeune were pulled from service and refit to accommodate additional 1500 Marines along with their
associated equipment, combat transporters and landing craft. This particular modification necessitated the removal of 50% of the
vessel’s torpedo launch capacity, but their utility as assault landing vessels proved invaluable on numerous occasions.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The computer core aboard the Normandy is a virtual copy of the type developed for the
Excelsior-class, albeit minus most of the dedicated storage and exploration specific processors that the original class depended on.
Instead, modules geared more toward tactical analysis and signal processing were installed to assist with her Military Operations
geared mission scope. Crew accommodations are fairly basic and throughout her deployment the Normandy was considered to be a
crowded and manpower intensive vessel. This is one of the primary factors that led to her deactivation in both 2360 and immediately
following the Dominion War.

Development and Construction History: Of the 40 Normandy-class dreadnoughts that entered service, none remain in active
deployment. Twelve remain in mothballs, nine have been scrapped, nine have been destroyed in the line of duty, one has been sold to
a private research interest, three have been sold to the Corillian States, four are listed as lost, presumed destroyed, one is in reserve
status assigned to Starbase 72 and one is an engineering testbed with Starfleet Training Command.

   Conceived as a heavy battlecruiser to supplement the Excelsior-class, the Alaskas have faithfully served Starfleet for over fifty
years. Their Alaska’s 150 man compliment of Marines coupled with the vessel's admirable weapons capability enables her to react
swiftly and strongly to threats within the Federation. However, the early days of the program are steeped in controversy. Developed
side by side with the Ambassador-class in 2315, the Alaska was felt to be redundant, a step back in starship design. However, the
project engineers pressed on with the vessel, and technological innovations were incorporated into both ships. The duel
commissioning of the Ambassador and Alaska on the same day sparked the beginning of a competition to determine which class
would be given full construction contracts. In the end, both designs were found to be sound investments, and their years of devoted
service have more than justified their initial costs.

Classification: With a design emphasis on fleet operations and military support mission, the Alaska is designated as a battlecruiser.

Design: The Alaska-class hullform follows a traditional arrangement that has become a Starfleet trademark in the past 100 years. The
general layout is the familiar saucer section connected to a secondary hull with a connecting dorsal section. Twin nacelles trail out
from the engineering section in an arrangement that allows the Bussard collectors the most efficient access to interstellar gas
collection and lets the warp field layers combine effectively and propel the vessel at high speeds. In the years since its
commissioning, the Alaska’s general design has been incorporated into several other classes including the Merced, Iowa, Challenger
and Renown, a testament to its sturdy construction.

Engineering: The FIWA-1 warp drive that was initially fit on the Alaska provides ample power for her propulsive and tactical needs.
With a cruising speed of warp 6 and an emergency speed of 9.1, the Alaska was considered a swift vessel when she was introduced.
However, the realities of the modern day task force have necessitated a costly refit program to keep them in step with newer vessels.
Additionally, the FIG-3 impulse drive provides sufficient maneuvering power at sublight speeds but has been criticized as being
inadequate for most auxiliary power generation needs.

Tactical: The FH-11 phaser array aboard the Alaska has been the standard heavy beam weapon in the Starfleet inventory for the last
90 years. Although supplanted by larger and more accurate types in recent years, it is still a powerful system. The FP-4 torpedo
launchers were removed in the Mk II refit cycle in favor of the more modern FP-10 delivery system. The tactical sensors and
command/control facilities were also refurbished to reinvigorate the Alaska’s role as a mobile theater operations center. The Marine
facilities were also modernized to incorporate the latest in support systems and training methodology.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: Until the Galaxy-class was introduced in 2358, the Alaska was one of the largest starships in
existence. Her 850 member crew and 150 member Marine detachment enjoy a comfortable existence aboard ship with access to
numerous recreational and educational facilities. With a design emphasis on border and task force operations, these amenities were
built into the ship’s design to counter the expected long on-station patrol times. The computer systems aboard the Alaska are of a
standard isolinear makeup that has proven ample for the vessel’s needs. No major system upgrades are planned for the immediate
future.




                                                                  20

Development and Construction History:
The Alaska-class is no longer in production. Of the sixteen vessels built, ten remain in service with one in the reserve fleet. Two
starships, the Cannae and Franklin were destroyed in the Battle of Wolf 359. The starship Vosper was built specifically for operations
with the Starfleet Naval Reserve, and has served in that capacity since commissioning. Extensive refits were executed between 2378
and 2380 with three vehicles pre year taking part until project completion.

                Flight 1 Alaska-class starships
                Alaska-Fife Initial order of six production vessels expanded in 2324 to a total of sixteen. All completed to initial
                design specifications. USS Hastings briefly fit with an external Mobile Intermetric Spaceborne Warning and Control
                (MIC-WAC) sensor system in 2351. Equipment removed and the project was canceled in 2352 after the technology
                proved to be unworkable.

                Flight 2 Alaska-class starships
                Only comprised of vessels refit to block specifications. Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) refits starting in
                2378 at a rate of three vessels per year until completion. Incorporates much needed warp drive modifications, heavier
                shields, the FP-10 torpedo array, an additional forward phaser array and an enlarged impulse drive to increase
                auxiliary power reserves.

The starship Alaska led what is considered to be one of the most violently unlucky lives in Starfleet history. Soon after the trials
against the Ambassador in 2329, the Alaska was undergoing a routine maintenance check at Spacedock Terra when something went
catastrophically wrong. Just as the ship's senior staff was entering the walkway connecting the Alaska to the stations docking ring, a
nearby "workbee" maintenance shuttle lost attitude control and began to tumble. The out of control craft struck the gangway, opening
it to the vacuum outside. Before the rescue crews could react, the Alaska's entire senior staff succumbed to asphyxiation. A new crew
was assigned later that week. However, the vessel only lasted another five years under the command of Captain Steven Vance, her
career ending when the Alaska came under attack by Klingon raiders in May of 2334.

The Raven War produced many unlikely heroes in its two years, but none are more deserving than the starship Vosper. The Vosper
was constructed in 2331 and almost immediately reverted to the Starfleet Naval Reserve. In peacetime, the vessel operates within
Federation space with a skeleton crew performing a number of tasks. However, at the outset of war, the vessel was called for duty in
the Triangle region. On stardate 4/7607.15, the Vosper was part of a three ship patrol near Orenada II when it was attacked by a
Romulan force. During the battle, a Romulan Pyre-class cruiser is badly damaged and captured, allowing Starfleet to remove valuable
tactical data from her computer, giving them a slight advantage early in the war. The Vosper was awarded a unit citation for gallantry
on the battlefield, the first such award for a S.N.R. vessel in decades.

One of the legacies of the Dominion War that ran from 2373-2375 was a proliferation of offensive gravitic mines spread throughout
the shipping lanes of the Federation. The long tedious task of clearing these mines had been under way for two years without incident
when the USS Jutland met a terrible disaster. The starship was assigned to a sparsely populated mine field near the Makin System and
had been performing her duty for nearly two weeks. The last report received from the Jutland showed that she had just completed a
grid sweep and was approaching what appeared to be a Jem’hadar vessel adrift in the field. Long range surveillance sensors later
showed that the entire field lit up with a massive graviton pulse and then faded leaving no sign of the Jutland. A subsequent search of
the region yielded no debris or clues as to the vessels fate, and the Jutland has since been declared overdue, presumed destroyed.

   In the late 2270s with the Constitution-class approaching the end of her production run, Starfleet ordered a new class of starship to
serve as the Federation's exploration and military arm well into the next century. The new vessel would incorporate the largest
computer system ever mounted on a starship, a new quadri-trasducer shield system with a field output 20% more powerful than the
strongest generators currently in use, and the experimental (and highly controversial) transwarp drive. A general hull design was soon
settled upon with warp field dynamics modeling taking place even as the first unit was under construction. The first vessel, NX-2000,
USS Excelsior, was ready for trials in 2285. The "Great Expriment" was under way.

Classification: The sheer size and firepower of the Excelsior when she was first introduced garnered her the label battlecruiser.
Although she no longer meets the modern standards of that classification, she has retained the designation for tradition’s sake.

Design: The Excelsior was a radical departure from starship designs of her day. While she retains the traditional primary
hull/engineering section/twin nacelle arrangement found on most starship designs, her internal arrangement was in sharp contrast to
the designs of the time. The hullform was initially designed to push through theoretical transwarp wavefront event horizons and
withstand the transition down to conventional warp velocities. When the transwarp project was labeled a failure in 2385, new
conventional engines were mounted with nominal changes made to the original hull design.

Engineering: The FIWA-1 warp drive mounted on the Excelsior has proven itself to be one of the most reliable units in Federation
history. With few changes, the drive has remained in the Starfleet inventory for over nearly 100 years and is expected to remain there
for many more. With the initial transwarp drive units having been discarded as unworkable, the powerful but unproven FIWA-1 was
fit on the USS Excelsior and proved itself to be quite satisfactory. Her top speed of warp 9 was not revolutionary, but it was suitable
for the Excelsior’s needs. Over the years since, the drive has been improved to provide velocities of warp 9.3 with a newly fielded
version reaching 9.65. The impulse drive assembly was a novel arrangement for the time utilizing one fusion reactor with multiple
exhaust ports. This allowed the vessel to utilize thrust vectoring for greater maneuverability at sublight speeds.

Tactical: The weapon system mounted aboard the early Excelsiors were not particularly revolutionary for their day, but they were
present in greater quantities than ever before providing protection from every conceivable approach angle. The FP-4 photon torpedoes
mounted in a now standardized fore/aft configuration provide unheard of launch potential for a vessel of that era. Until a massive
refurbishing project was begun in 2374, the tactical systems aboard the Excelsior’s remained virtually unchanged aside from some
minor upgrades with each new design cycle. The FSS shield system used aboard the Excelsior was a very robust unit for its day with
a field output far surpassing anything currently in the inventory. Although it is just barely adequate for modern needs, the unit
remains in wide service and will remain there until all existing spaceframes are refit to Mk VIII standards.




                                                                  24

Crew Support/Computer Systems: While the Excelsior is only moderately larger than the Constitution-class starships it replaced,
her crew compliment is nearly double. For a vessel designed for long range patrols and missions of exploration, the Excelsior is a
crowed vessel by any means. The addition of holodecks and other modern comforts have greatly reduced this burden on the crew in
recent years making assignment to an Excelsior-class starship a more bearable experience. The computer facilities aboard the
Excelsiors were the first to utilize the now standard isolinear storage and distribution system, and is more than adequate for the
vessel’s needs.

Development and Construction History: Current plans call for the Excelsiors to end their production run in 2387 on the 100th
anniversary of the class’ introduction. Production has taken place at virtually every construction yard in the Federation with a primary
focus on Terran based facilities. Of the 86 Excelsiors built to date, 53 remain in active service. Five of them, the Repulse, Roosevelt,
Intrepid, Trenton and Melbourne were destroyed by the Borg at the Battle of Wolf 359.

                 Flight 1 Excelsior-class starships
                 Excelsior-Eagle First production units produced to initial design specs. Later fit out to Block III specifications after

                 Flight 8 Excelsior-class starships
                 Indestructible-Earhart Second attempt to field an untra modern version of the Excelsior-class. Begain with a refit of
                 the training ship Kongo and museum vessel Missouri and soon moved into full production. All previously built Type
                 I Excelsior’s with the exception of the Block VIs will be refit to these specs at a rate of three per year. Construction
                 began on new units in 2376 at a rate of one per year. This model incorporates a concealed collimated phaser array
                 with terminus ports in the old turret mounts. An upgraded shield system provides protection unheard of for an
                 Excelsior to date, and a new warp drive has been mounted that outperforms all previous models fit aboard the
                 Excelsior. The cruising range, sensor suite and lab facilities have also been expanded giving the class an ungraded
                 exploration capability.

On stardate 4/1303, Hyverian separatists seeking independence from their government performed a hit and run raid against the
Starfleet repair facility at Starbase 13. It was there that fifteen Hyverian agents masquerading as Starfleet officers boarded the USS
Defiant, the Chandley-class USS Glencoe and Bader-class USS Marysville during the midwatch and began their acts of sabotage.
With charges set on the warp cores of all three vessels, the terrorists beamed out to their waiting ship without being noticed and fled
the scene. Several hours later, one after another, all three Federation starships were blown from their moorings and disintegrated.
With most of their crews on shore leave of off duty, the loss of life was limited to the on-duty personnel and several members of the
Starbase’s repair teams. Despite a thorough search, the terrorists responsible for the destruction were never brought to justice.

On stardate 4/5708.22, Starfleet received word that the Cardassians were pulling out of the shipyards at Boraes III in a fleet wide
response to render aid to the homeworld during a planet wide epidemic. The Boreas shipyards were a prime starship construction and
repair depot and serviced half of their border fleet. Starfleet felt that the destruction of the facility could very well end the war. A
fleet of twenty-one vessels were sent to Boreas to drive off her defenders and eliminate the facility. However, upon approaching the
station, no less that 50 enemy cruisers pulled from the planet's sensor shadow and overwhelmed the Federation fleet. Lost in the
ambush were the Excelsior-class starships Kitty Hawk and Goliath. Of the vessels in the original task force, only the Freedom-class
starship Sharnhorst escaped alive.

On stardate 4/7003.05 Task Force 71, consisting of the USS Exeter, USS Eagle and USS Independence is attacked by forces of the
Imperial Klingon States while patrolling near the Triangle region. Recent border raids by the IKS had been heightening tensions in the
region and had brought the local shipping lanes to a virtual standstill. Force 71 was assigned the task of flushing out the raiders and
permanently eject them from Federation space. After a week of searching, an IKS raiding force of six battlecruisers is discovered well
inside Federation space, and the Starfleet forces pounces at the attack. The enemy is soundly defeated, but not before all three
Federation vessels suffer varying degrees of extensive damage. Starfleet decides to patch the ships together for one final trip to
Memory Beta, the Federation starship retirement depot.

On stardate 4/7702.26 near Romulan space, the starships Excelsior-class USS Potemkin and her escort, the USS Triumph observe from
long range two Warbirds attempting to cross into Federation space. Starfleet feared that the two enemy vessels are trying to attack a
nearby supply/repair depot, and orders the starships to attack. The Starfleet vessels soon find themselves in dire straits, being
outclassed by two modernized Leviathan-class Warbirds. The Triumph fell early, but was able to get off most of her crew before
exploding under a barrage of disruptor fire. The Potemkin fought on to protect the helpless crewmen in the Triumph's escape pods,
but is soon badly crippled. With well over 70% of her crew dead or wounded, a boarding party takes over the Potemkin, marking her
the first major Federation vessel captured during the Raven War. It is believed that most of her crew and the crew of the Triumph are
taken prisoner. After the war 127 crewmen from the Potemkin and 23 from the Triumph are reparated home. The Potemkin herself is
kept as a war prize and is on display in orbit above Remus.

   The USS Excelsior had been out of the builder’s yard for only a few months in 2387 when Starfleet Engineering began to make
plans for the class’ future. A modified version of the Excelsior with improved structural systems and weapons was in the works even
before the class ship was commissioned. While these behemoths were expected to lead Starfleet’s exploration and diplomatic
missions for decades to come, it was generally felt that they were lacking in tactical support systems and offensive firepower.
However, the Excelsior were already some of the most costly vessels ever produced, and even further additions to her already crowed
spec sheet would push development and deployment costs through the roof. It was therefore decided that only one out of nine of these
vessels would be fit to specifications that would designate them Excelsior II-class battleships.

Classification:. Like the type I Excelsiors, the type II is designated as a battlecruiser.

Design: The Excelsior II retains the traditional primary hull/engineering section/twin nacelle arrangement found on the original class
vessels. The secondary hull has been further fit with bulbous equipment bays jutting out from the main deflector array and continuing
to the aft sections of the vessel. The aft section of the saucer section was completely redesigned to incorporate addition fusion
reactors and their associated fuel tanks and equipment.

Engineering: The FIWA-1 warp drive was retained for the Excelsior II with one notable change. Large baffles were affixed to the
front of the nacelles to channel away and disperse warp field emissions. This system, unique to the Excelsior IIs, allows the vessels to
limit their sensor return signal and prevents detection at long ranges. The additional impulse drives provide not only extra auxiliary
power, but also superb handling by utilizing thrust vectoring.

Tactical: The type II is a distinctly different vessel from the original version when their weapons and tactical arrays are compared.
The Excelsior II sports not only more but heavier phasers than the initial production batch Excelsiors with an improved targeting and
communications suite for fleet operations. However, the FP-4 torpedo system was retained with virtually no changes due to
limitations in the existing systems.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: With an emphasis on long deployment missions like exploration, research, border patrols and
diplomatic functions, the Excelsior IIs rarely get to spend time in port. The recreational and support systems aboard these vessels are
exemplary and have served them well in the decades since they were first introduced. The computer system is identical to the one
used aboard the Excelsior type I, and is adequate for the ship’s needs.

Development and Construction History: Of the 14 Excelsior II-class vessels built to date, 10 remain in active service.
Construction of these vessels were suspended in 2360 after the commissioning of the USS King’s Destroyer, but several recent
developments have breathed new life into this successful subclass. The 100th anniversary Excelsior-class starship is a new version of
the Excelsior II with no expense spared in her construction. Planned as the last four Excelsiors to be built, they will sport an all new
drive system, the heaviest shield system available, a completely redesigned tactical suite and an exploration capability unsurpassed in
the fleet. Current plans call for the USS Daring, the last Excelsior, to be launched on the USS Excelsior’s centennial commissioning
day.

the Galaxy would be a phenomenal success, but its cost limited the fleet to six, or at most twelve hulls. To counter this, Starfleet
Engineering drew on the new technologies coming out of the Galaxy design and produced the Challenger, and later derived from it the
Iowa. Designed as a battlecruiser with a primary focus on military operations, the Iowa has been a moderate success. Although it
packs the same shields, weapons, and engine systems of the Galaxy, the Iowa’s cost is much less than her bigger brothers.

Classification: The Iowa is classified as a battlecruiser with an emphasis on fleet operations.

Design: The Iowa is derived from the successful Alaska class hullform with an enlarged saucer section and reworked secondary hull.

Engineering: Iowa-class starships are equipped with an improved version of the revolutionary FUWA-2 (Federation Improved Warp
type A/2) warp drive developed and first fielded by the Galaxy-class. The drive system is capable of propelling the vessel at speeds
up to warp 9.6 with a cruising speed of warp 6. Impulse power is provided by the FIH-1 system made famous on the Apollo-class
starships in the years before. In retrospect, the FIH series was a poor choice for the massive Iowa, as its low thrust-to-weight ratio can
only sustain moderate sublight speeds leaving the Iowas prone to flanking attacks. This more than anything has led to the their high
attrition rate in recent years. A Mk II refit program for the Iowa began in 2382 and will address this and several other design flaws.

Tactical: The Iowa’s tactical array is a mishmash of new weapons and older, proven designs. The phaser armament is made up of
two FH-15 collimator strips mounted on the saucer covering the ship in a 300° arc. Secondary armament is provided by four banks of
proven FH-11 phaser turrets for a backup punch. The photon torpedo compliment is a similar mix with the new FP-10 launcher
covering the forward arc and the venerable FP-4 system covering the sides and aft. The Iowa was also designed around two other
tactical elements, the CIC (Combat Information Center) Suite and a 150 man Marine detachment. The CIC suite allows the Iowas to
coordinate the fleet movements of up to fifty starships or act as a mobile starbase, a valuable asset in wartime. The Marines act not




                                                                   32

only as shipboard security but can be used to secure ground objectives and perform boarding actions, tasks that normal Starfleet
security officers are sometimes ill prepared or trained to do.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: Although she was designed at a time when family accommodations were being included on
every new starship class, the Iowa is an exception that that rule. Instead, decks six through nine are the sole property of the Marine
detachment, their equipment and training facilities. In wartime, the 150 man contingent can be increased to nearly 750 men for short
periods of time. The normal Starfleet crew enjoys the standard shipboard amenities found on most vessels, and her fittings are second
only to the larger explorer type ships. The Iowa’s secondary role of fleet command vessel allows for an additional 120 officers when
she is acting in that capacity, which means that with a full crew compliment, admiral’s staff and marine contingent, the Iowas can take
on over 1700 crewmen at once.

Development and Construction History: The Iowa-class was a joint design by Starfleet Engineering of San Francisco with advanced
computer modeling and testing taking place at Utopia Planitia. The vessel’s of the class were produced at nearly every major shipyard
in the Federation and were constructed at a rate of three every two years. Of the 24 Iowas constructed, 14 remain in active service
with one, the USS Virginia serving with Starfleet Training Command. New vessel construction was suspended in 2375 after the end
of the Dominion War with the last existing spaceframe commissioning in 2380.

                 Flight 1 Iowa-class starships
                 Iowa-Oklahoma All production starships built to design specifications. Initial production order of ten vessels
                 expanded to twenty-five in 2365. Last production unit cancelled in 2375 at the cesation of hostilities with the
                 Dominion.

                 Flight 2 Iowa-class starships
                 Only comprised of vessels refit to block specifications. Refits scheduled to begin in 2382 at a rate of two vessels per
                 year until project completion. Will address long standing concerns relating to the Iowa’s poor sublight maneuvering
                 capability, primary power distribution systems, and crew support facilities. The refits will also replace the torpedo
                 launchers with an all FP-10 suite and add FH-16 phasers to allow longer range attack options.

On stardate 4/7406.22, the starship Wisconsin, under the command of Captain Richard Scott, was assigned to negotiate navigation
rights through the Macon System. During the talks, the system was invaded by the Macon's nearby rivals, the Breen. The Macon
premiere agreed to grant the Federation navigation rights through the system if they would grant the Macon's associate Federation
membership and repel the landing forces taking the planet. Admiral James Carmichael, who was observing the talks, agreed and
ordered the Wisconsin to attack the Breen landing ships. The enemy was quickly beaten back, but had managed to land over 1200
troops within the Macon capital. Using the Wisconsin's transporters, Carmichael then cleared the capital of all Breen life signs, ending
the invasion. Admiral Carmichael was later awarded the Andorian Battle Star for his ingenuity, and the action has since been dubbed
the "Carmichael Defense."

   The Galaxy-class starship represents Starfleet's most sophisticated achievement in multimission ship systems design. Intended
primarily as a tool of exploration and defense, the vessel represents a powerful leap in Starfleet tactical capabilities. However, the
original Galaxy design fails to take full advantage of these capabilities due to its "wasted space" used on civilian quarters and science
labs. To remedy this problem, Starfleet authorized the construction of two Galaxy-class hulls into a full fledged battlecruiser
configuration. The plans called for the addition of barracks for up to 1500 Marines, a Combat Information Center (CIC), and
dedicated Military Operations Passive/Active sensor suites. When the vessel was launched, her new improvements warranted
designating her as a separate class from the Galaxys. On February 2, 2375, the USS Mythe, the first Mythe-class battlecruiser, was
commissioned.

Classification: The Mythe-class is a true battlecruiser with an emphasis on mobile tactical fleet operations and support.

Design: Based around the engine configuration and tactical systems of the defunct Mk IIx Galaxy-class starship, the Mythe is
virtually indistinguishable from her exploration command cousins, performance wise and externally.

Engineering: The FUWR-1 warp drive fit aboard the Mythe provides superb power reserves and an impressive emergency speed of
warp 9.92 for up to twelve hours with a cruising speed of warp 6. The primary FII-2 impulse drive with backup twin FIH-1s provide
more than adequate auxiliary and maneuvering power at sublight speeds.

Tactical: The tactical system aboard the Mythe is one of the most deadly types mounted aboard a Federation starship today. The FH-
18 phaser systems provide a massive capability for directed energy attacks against multiple threat vectors with twin FP-10 torpedo
launchers providing a backup photon/quantum punch.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: Although the Mythe is built around the Galaxy-class hull, her crew support facilities are a clear
departure from the original designer’s plans. Instead of warm bright corridors and friendly plush quarters, the Mythe is more spartan in
its comforts. The Marine barracks take up almost all of decks 11-14, and training is virtually around the clock. Capable of
comfortably holding 1500 Marines or up to 5000 for short durations, the vessel is crowded by even Starfleet standards. Crew lounges
buzz with activity day and night, and the holodecks are more likely to be used for battle simulations than the more popular woodland
parks programs. The bridge is much darker and more austere than most other starships. The lack of carpeting or wood paneling and
its replacement by steel decking is more to reduce the chance of fire than to intimidate. Early plans calls for the removal of the
spaceframe’s saucer separation capability to make room for additional storage and training facilities. However, there was concern that
the vessel’s current lifeboat and shuttle facilities were incapable of evacuating the entire ship’s compliment and Marine contingent in
an emergency situation. It is for this reason alone that the separated flight mode feature has been retained for the Mythe-class.

Development and Construction History: Of the three Mythe-class battlecruisers constructed, all remain in active service. All were
constructed at Utopia Planitia and there are no plans for additional vessels of this class. The USS Dreadnought (ex-USS Thunderer) is
expected to be the final Mythe-class starship and was converted midway through her construction as a Galaxy-class explorer.

   Without question, the Excelsior-class starship remains one of the most successful designs in Federation history. Hence, it is not
surprise that Starfleet turned to this vessel when it was contemplating the building of a new battlecruiser for fleet operations in the
mid-2310s. The new vessel’s focus would be on border operations and assault support missions, a duty that the Excelsior was capable
of but not designed for. Whereas the Excelsior was a multipurpose vessel of exploration and defense, the new design would focus
wholly on the military operations side of life in the fleet. By 2323, the first Onslaught-class battlecruiser was ready for service.

Classification: The Onslaught is classed as a battlecruiser.

Design: The idea of taking a proven vessel and adapting it to a specific mission profile saved the Onslaught design planners a whole
six years from their production plan. Externally the new battlecruiser is virtually indistinguishable from her forebears down to the last
rivet. However, once one looks inside the differences become immediately obvious. All of decks five through nine have been
dedicated to the inclusions and support of a 1000 man Marine contingent. This includes all of the training equipment, weapons and
dormitories needed to support a battalion for months at a time. However, in peacetime the contingent rarely passes the fifty-member
mark with these men acting as the ship’s security contingent. To further ground the Onslaught in the role of battlecruiser, the vessel is
equipped with long range surveillance sensors, classified electronic warfare equipment, and a communications suite that allows the
Onslaught to act as a border command post or fleet command ship in a crisis situation.

Engineering: The Onslaught incorporates the same FIWA-1 warp drive and FIG-3 impulse drive that was built into the Mk V
Excelsiors. With a top speed of warp 9.3 for twelve hours or warp 6 for cruising, the Onslaught is considered slow by modern
standards. However, planned upgrades within the next ten years should get their performance back to acceptable levels.

Tactical: The weapons aboard the Onslaught are not only powerful but are present in abundance. Her phasers cover every
conceivable approach angle while her FP-4 torpedo launchers provide a heavy close in punch. However, like her engine systems, the
firepower aboard the Onslaught is showing its age and upgrades are planned for the near future.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: To include the massive Marine facilities, the Onslaught’s crew requirements were drastically
reduced from 800 to 450 regular crewmen. To this end, the crew quarters and recreational facilities are some of the most spacious in
the fleet and a peacetime assignment to an Onslaught is a popular assignment. The computer system mounted aboard ship are the
same type developed for the initial Excelsiors and is dated though adequate by modern standards.

Development and Construction History: Of the 50 Onslaught-class battlecruisers constructed, only 20 remain in active service with
two-thirds of the total losses attributed to the Dominion War. Construction ended in 2367 with the commissioning of the
USS Dendrasi at the Utopia Planitia Fleet Yard on Mars.

    Starfleet’s policy of redesigning successful exploration vessels into defensive platforms started in 2318 with the laying down of the
USS Onslaught, the first warship design derived from the Excelsior-class hull. Since then, no less than seven other ship class’ have
undergone the same redesign process, a course that lets Starfleet Engineering develop defensive assets after field trials have proven the
initial vessel plan. To conform to the new standards, the vessel’s internal layout is changed to help decrease the chance of internal
fires spreading to adjacent compartments and lower the severity of hull breaches. Next, the lab space is removed and the sensor suite
is replaced with a combat and electronic surveillance oriented array. Crew quarters are then reduced by 40% by allowing only the
senior staff the luxury of a private stateroom with all other officers and crewmen sharing double or quadruple person suites. This
allows the inclusion of the battlecruiser’s Marine contingent, a shipboard presence that can be as low as 25 men in peacetime or up to
1500 men on some of the larger vessels. In addition to providing a ground assault capability for the starship, they also provide
shipboard security, a task usually relegated to Starfleet crewmen. Lastly, the vessel is fit with a CIC (Combat Information Center)
with provisions for a flag staff up to 60 men, a feature than turns a battlecruiser into a mobile field starbase, a valuable asset in
wartime. In the early 2360s, the Akira-class cruiser was proving herself to be an invaluable tactical asset and capable explorer, but
Starfleet wanted push the limits of the design. By November of 2364, production of the first Pegasus-class battlecruiser, a design
based on the Akira, was approved and construction began the following spring.

Classification: The Pegasus-class is designated as a battlecruiser with an emphasis on tactical fleet support operations.

Design: The Pegasus is identical to the Akira-class on a visual scan with most design changes internalized.

Engineering: The same FUWR-1warp drive that was pioneered aboard the Akira is present aboard the Pegasus providing comparable
performance. Equally, the same FIG-2 impulse drives are present with few revisions and provide sufficient auxiliary power.

Tactical: The FH-16 and FP-10 torpedo system mounted aboard the Akira have carried over to the Pegasus with only minor changes
to their targeting software and pre-fire sequencers. The primary changes to the Pegasus’ tactical systems are her CIC suite, 200
member Marine contingent and sensor array. All taken together, the combination makes the Pegasus a formidable fleet command
vessel and mobile starbase.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The Pegasus is quite a bit more crowded than her counterpart the Akira, but this is offset by
admirable recreational and entertainment facilities. Aside from the frequent border patrols that are the hallmark of life aboard a
Military Operations starship, the Pegasus’ spend a lot of time in port or in task force workups, and the crew has reasonable access to
other non-shipboard diversions. The computer system aboard the Pegasus is the same type of isolinear system developed for the
Akira.

Development and Construction History: Construction of the Pegasus ended in 2379 with ten units built and seven remaining in
service to this day. Although they performed admirably, the construction program was canceled at the conclusion of the Dominion
war to make way for newly emerging designs.

   From its launching in 2329 to the commissioning of the Galaxy-class starships in 2358, the Renown was by far the most powerful
starship in the Alpha Quadrant. Although she was originally designed as a battlecrusier, the Renown came to be known as an intrepid
pioneer by charting the most far-flung regions of the Federation. Designed in tandem with the Ambassador and Alaska-class starships,
the Renown borrows heavily from the technologies emerging from those projects and would set the standard for multimission starships
design in the years that followed.

Classification: Although she has an impressive capability for research and exploration, the Renown is designated as a battlecruiser
due to several shipboard tactical and support systems designed for offensive operations.

Design: To the casual observer, the Renown’s hullform is a near fusion of the Ambassador-class’ saucer section and the Alaska’s
stardrive. However, once one looks inside, a unique internal layout is found with an emphasis on crew support systems, fleet
command facilities and damage control.

Engineering: The first incarnation of the Renown mounted the successful FIWA-2 warp drive that was initially designed for the
Ambassador-class. Capable of driving the vessel at speeds of up to warp 9.2 with a cruising speed of warp 6, the engine remained a
part of the Renown’s design until 2378. At that time, the revolutionary FUWA-2 warp drive system by Shuvinaaljis was fit increasing
the Renown’s top speed to warp 9.65. Twin FIG-2 impulse drives were also a part of the Renown’s powerplant until that same year
when they were replaced with more powerful FIH-2s.

Tactical: The weapons and tactical support systems aboard the early incarnations of the Renown were the standard fair for starships
of her day. Her real advantage was an impressive torpedo launch capability that covered the vessel equally in all directions. The
primary FH-11 phaser array was lifted from the Excelsior-class, but the real punch was a forward firing phaser cannon. Three linked
FH-14 phasers provided a massive one punch barrage that outclassed any competing phaser system by 50%. In addition, the Renown
carries provisions for a 350 man Marine detachment, a valuable asset in wartime or in civil support missions. The forty-five man
Command and Control (C&C) suite provides the communications and support systems to coordinate the activities of an entire sector if
need be.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The Renown is crowded by Starfleet standards, and the Marine complement rarely passes the
fifty member mark. However, at one point during the Cardassian War in 2359, the USS Renown boasted a compliment of 997 regular
crewmen, 397 Marines, 88 mission specialists, 133 refugees from the colony on Leland Prime, and 42 members of Admiral Thestiks'
battle staff. As Captain James D. Carmichael said of that time in his log, "We practically had people sleeping in the Jeffries tubes!"
Refits have kept the crew support systems in pace with newer starship design, and the implementation of holodecks and other
amenities is a high priority for mission planners. Although adequate for its day, the isolinear computer system aboard the Renown is
becoming dated, and enhancements are planned for the next refit cycle.

Development and Construction History: The Renown-class was initially planned as a series of six vessels to be launched over a
period of 10 years. However, the astronomical cost of the one constructed unit put a stop to further vessels of the class. The second
planned Renown, the USS Victoria, was placed in mothballs 35% into her construction, but was later fit out and completed in 2378.
To honor the Excelsior-class starship USS Hood that was lost in battle in the months before, the Victoria was rechristened to honor
that vessel upon commissioning. Of the two starships of the Renown-class, both remain in active service.

   The Ambassador-class project has spanned nearly fifty years, and stands testament to her designer's foresight. Conceived as a long
range explorer and instrument of Federation policy, the Ambassadors remain an integral part of Starfleet to this day. The design is
also one of the most improved upon in history. In the mid-2340s, in response to hostilities taking place with the Tholians, Starfleet
sought to modify the Ambassador design. What the fleet needed was a new command ship, a vessel with the capability to lead the
modern task force into battle and be flexible enough to not only secure the space above a contested planet but the surface as well.
What came out of the redesign project was the wildly successful Rigel-class battlecruiser.

Classification: The Rigel is a battlecruiser with a secondary emphasis on tactical fleet operations and support.

Design: The Rigel is visibly identical on a visual scan to the Ambassador-class and the two are often mistaken for each other. In fact,
Starfleet is replete with examples of this parallel design process. The idea is to cause confusion with the enemy so that they don’t
know if they are going up against an exploration vessel or a well armed military operations battle wagon. In fact, Starfleet
Engineering will go as far as masking the battlecruiser’s energy signature to match their more peaceful cousins to further discourage
an aggressive adversary.

Engineering: Engineering advances coming out of the Galaxy-class project allowed for improvements to the Rigel’s FIWA-2 warp
drive. The new system allows a top speed of warp 9.5 for 12 hours with a cruising speed of warp 6. Impulse/auxiliary power is
provided by the trustworthy FIH-2 impulse drive and provides adequate if not marginal performance at subluminal velocities.

Tactical: The phaser array mounted aboard the Rigel is the same superb type already mounted aboard the Ambassador-class.
However, the Rigel once again benefited from the Galaxy project by inheriting its improved FP-10 torpedo launch system, an array
much more powerful than the FP-4 mounted aboard the Ambassador. The Rigel also mounts the Galaxy’s FSS-M shield system for
extra protection and includes a heavy 375 man Marine detachment for ground attack missions and shipboard security. Paired with an
Olympic-class hospital ship's relief capabilities, the Rigel's Marine compliment makes a formidable disaster relief team. With the
inclusion of a CIC (Combat Information Center) suite, it was hoped that the Rigels would be able to serve as mobile command
platforms, and can perform in that function with great success. However, in light of newer starship designs, this function has been de-
emphasized in Rigels constructed after 2368.




                                                                  44

Crew Support/Computer Systems: With her large Marine detachment taking up all of decks 6 –10, the Rigels are crowed vessels.
However, even with such a large crew compliment the vessel’s recreational facilities are comparable to a normal cruiser her size due
to the long patrol periods the ships are expected to endure. In exchange, the Rigel’s capacity for exploration or research is
rudimentary and the Rigels are rarely utilized in this fashion. However, they are popular vessels and are considered prime assignments
for command and engineering support personnel. The computer system used aboard the Rigel is the same type developed for the
Galaxy-class and provides far more computing power than the vessel could possibly utilize.

Development and Construction History: Of the 22 Rigel-class starships constructed, fourteen remain in active service. Two, the
Tolstoy and San Jacinto, were destroyed by the Borg at the Battle of Wolf 359. Construction of new vessels of the class was canceled
in late 2376 with the cessation of hostilities with the Dominion. No more new units are planned. Construction took place at numerous
facilities throughout the Federation with initial design and building taking place at Utopia Planitia on Mars.

Historical Notes:
           Tolstoy          One of 39 starships destroyed by the Borg at the Battle of Wolf 359 on stardate 4/6701.
           San Jacinto      One of 39 starships destroyed by the Borg at the Battle of Wolf 359 on stardate 4/6701.
           Xenophon         Destroyed by the Borg at the Battle of Typhon on stardate 4/7305.
           Vulcan           Declared lost, presumed destroyed while patrolling the Ferengi border on stardate 4/6902.
                            Later discovered abandoned and gutted by fire in the Grekka Nebula on stardate 4/7703.
           Manhattan        Destroyed by Jem’hadar forces in an attack against a Dominion communications array in the Argolis
                            Cluster on 4/7402. One of 98 Seventh Fleet ships lost in the action.
           Birmingham       Destroyed by Romulan forces at the Battle of DS-13 on stardate 4/7906.
           Commandant       Destroyed by Romulan forces near starbase 12 on stardate 4/7711.
           Silversides      One of fifteen starships destroyed near Starbase 354 by Dominion forces on stardate 4/7404.

The starship Demeter has the singular distinction of being the only starship to surrender to forces of the Pakled Space Service. The
starship was on patrol near Pakled space on stardate 4/7308.22 when the vessel struck a quantum filament, disabling the ship's engines
and tactical systems. The Pakled destroyer Pornak was the first to arrive on the scene and demanded that starship's immediate
surrender. Although the Demeter's captain knew that the starship Birmingham was nearby and under way to help effect repairs, he
was forced to stall for time until her arrival. After signaling his capitulation to the Pakled commander, the Demeter was boarded by
ten well armed Pakled officers. After leading the Pakleds on a tour of the vessel and treating them to a lengthy luncheon in their
honor, the starship Birmingham arrived on the scene. The Pornak was quickly driven off and the Pakled officers were taken to
Starfleet Security for processing and eventual reparation. The Demeter was towed back to Starbase 351 by the Birmingham for
repairs.

On stardate 4/6902.14, the USS Vulcan was several days into a two month deployment along the Ferengi border with the intention of
monitoring and regulating commerce through the region. On that day, the vessel was in direct communication with Starbase 375 when
the commanding officer reported a bright light off the vessel’s starboard beam, the vessel lurched and the message terminated. The
starship Merrimac was immediately sent to the scene but found no trace of the Vulcan. After an intense search, the vessel was later
declared lost, presumed destroyed. Eight years later, the science ship USS Aldrin was performing a survey of the Grekka Nebula on
stardate 4/7703 when it found debris consistent with the hull of a Federation starship. Following the trail, they eventually found the
saucer section, connecting dorsal and the fore section of the engineering hull of the Vulcan floating dead in space. Clad in
containment suits, the Aldrin’s crew beamed aboard and found the hull burnt out and abandoned with the saucer shuttle bay and the
life board davits empty. All attempts to retrieve the ship’s log from the Vulcan’s badly damaged computer core failed, and the hulk
was later towed back to Starbase 213 for further analysis. No further clues to the Vulcan’s final minutes were ever found and the crew
remains missing to this day.

   The Abrams-class cruisers were designed as an "off the shelf" starship with a narrow mission scope. They were intended to fill the
gap between the more expensive starships and the need for a cheap, dependable cruiser. Initial studies showed that a de-emphasis on
crew amenities and high technology systems in favor of a more spartan outfit with older proven systems did not necessarily mean the
vessel would be without value. As a border tripwire and fast response vessel with the firepower of a starship, the Abrams-class could
indeed be a true asset. In actuality, the Abrams suffers from a lack of sustainable firepower, and her only redeeming qualities are her
high maneuverability, marine compliment and low cost. The Abrams is well suited for Federation internal security patrols or anti-
pirate operations, but is hard pressed to keep up with the needs of the modern heavy task force.

Classification: The Abrams was recently reclassified from heavy cruiser to cruiser to denote her changing status in the fleet.

Design: The Abrams is a simple design and follows an easy to manufacture hull form. The saucer section is mounted directly to a
small secondary hull that contains the warp core, fuel storage tanks and Marine facilities. Two nacelles trail off to the side and down
from the primary hull in a manner familiar to most Federation starships.

Engineering: For faster than light propulsion, the FIWD-2 warp drive that has proven itself so well aboard the Renaissance-class was
chosen for the Abrams. However, it is capable of driving the Abrams at only warp 9.0 for twelve hours with a cruising speed of warp
6. This more than anything has led to the vessel’s exclusion from task force operations in recent years. Conversely, her single FIG-3
impulse drive provides superb handling at sublight velocities and the Abrams is more than a match for any vessel at those speeds.




                                                                  48

Tactical: The weapons systems mounted aboard the Abrams starts with the standard FH-11 long-range phaser system that was
common to most Starfleet vessels of the era. The backup FP-4 torpedo launcher is a near copy of the type used aboard the New
Orleans-class frigate, and has proven to be a rock solid performer. The one-hundred member Marine compliment is included for
boarding actions and shipboard security and was added to the class almost as an afterthought.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The Abrams is a fairly spartan design with few luxuries aboard ship. While it does spend an
inordinate amount of time on border patrol and internal security sweeps, the vessels of the class have good access to port facilities for
their recreational needs. Onboard training facilities, quarters and equipment storage space for the Abrams’ marine contingent are
rarely in use and are often redressed by the vessel’s permanent crew for expanded living space. The isolinear computer system aboard
the Abrams is the same type built into the Miranda-class starships and is adequate for the vessel’s needs.

Development and Construction History: The Abrams-class is no longer in production. Of the thirty vessels built, twenty-three
remain in service in the Starfleet reserve. One, the Garnash Trell was destroyed by the Borg at the Battle of Wolf 359.

Historical Notes:
                Governor Ballantrye Destroyed by Orion pirate vessels while on a cargo run to Corillia Prime on stardate 4/6204.
                Admiral Carnes      One of ten starships destroyed by Imperial Klingon States forces at the Battle of K’tog on
                                    stardate 4/7703.
                Ambassador Crane Reported lost, presumed destroyed by patrolling the Romulan Neutral Zone on stardate 4/6107.
                Governor Gallas     One of ten starships destroyed by Imperial Klingon States forces at the Battle of K’tog on
                                    stardate 4/7703.
                Garnash Trell       One of thirty-nine vessels destroyed by the Borg at the Battle of Wolf 359 on stardate 4/6701.
                Joshawa Tyler       Destroyed by an unidentified spacial anomaly near starbase 221 on stardate 4/6701.
                Ambassador S'agora Destroyed by an unknown alien force in the Cambridge Sector on stardate 4/8007.

The Abrams-class cruisers are named after persons of note in Federation history. A combination of Admirals, Generals, Ambassadors
and Federation Presidents make up the list. One, the Admiral Hanson, is named in honor of Admiral J.P. Hanson, leader of the failed
attack against the Borg at the Battle of Wolf 359. Unlike the Mosby-class starships (who's are usually referred to by last name only),
the Abrams-class starships are normally referred to by their full namesakes.

On stardate 4/7901, the entire fleet of Abrams-class cruisers were reverted to the reserve status and distributed to starbases throughout
the Federation. They were assigned to bases in critical systems and placed under the command of the base's senior officer. The
vessels are normally crewed by a skeleton crew and kept in a state of readiness for immediate action. Although they are no longer a
commissioned part of the fleet, they can be called upon at a moments notice to come to the defense of the Federation. The move was
made to strengthen internal Federation lines and provide stability to otherwise critical but under patrolled areas.

On stardate 4/6204, the USS Governor Ballantrye was on the final leg of a supply run to the Corillia Prime when the Tronora Clan, an
offshoot of the Orion Pirate Cartel, attacked the lone vessel. With their force of four old but well armed Wanderer-class blockade
runners, the Orions quickly demanded that Captain S’esik of the Governor Ballantrye turn over his valuable shipment of FP-4 photon
torpedo casings. When S’esik refused, the Orions attempted to disable the Ballantrye’s shields to perform a boarding action. After a
furious firefight, the Orions managed to stop and board the Governor Ballantrye using transporters and several assault shuttles. The
fight spread to the vessel’s interior and the crew was in danger of losing control of the ship. With no other option, Captain S’esik
ordered the self-destruct set and the crew to abandon ship. The resulting explosion destroyed the Governor Ballantrye, her valuable
cargo and one of the boarding Orion vessels. Only 26 of the Governor Ballantrye’s 127 crewmen who made it to the lifeboats
survived the encounter and subsequent slaughter as the Orions attempted to cover their tracks by destroying the escape pods.
It would be three months before the survivors were picked up and their story was told leading to increased patrols in the Triangle
region.

   With the emergence of the Galaxy and Nebula-class starships in the 2350s, Starfleet had on its hands two valuable tools of
exploration. They were also two of the most powerful starships in existence, and the temptation to use them for defensive and patrol
purposes was intense. However, their mission of expanding the scope of Federation science and research was their primary goal, and
a call went out for a supplementary class to serve the fleet’s defensive needs. A mass produced heavy cruiser was envisioned with the
fastest warp drive ever produced and new tactical systems that would put any determined enemy at a costly disadvantage. Not
satisfied with leaning on the technologies emerging from the Galaxy-class development project, this design would spur on these
advancements and many others in what was to become the Akira and Pegasus-class starships.

Classification: The Akira is classified as a long range tactical cruiser with a secondary emphasis on exploration and research.

Design: The Akira is a remarkable design that draws inspiration from a number of vessels from Federation history and sports several
structural innovations. Her saucer section is fairly standard with a robust structural support system and roomy internal layout. From
either side of the bridge deck, the nacelle pylons stretch out and down from the main hull with a weapon/sensor pod suspended
between the two in the aft section. The positioning of the pylons serve to not only strengthen the vessel’s hull, but bury the bridge and
shield it from incoming weapons fire from several directions.

Engineering: The Akira-class was the first to incorporate the FUWR-1 warp drive as her primary propulsion system. The FUWR-1
was a revolutionary step up from the drive units of the last fifty years and even puts the Galaxy-class’ FUWA-1 to shame. Massive
space/time driver coils in the nacelle struts draw power from the EPS grid saving the Akira an additional 10-20% from the vessel’s
mass at sublight velocities making her more maneuverable at those speeds. The duel FIG-2 impulse drives provide ample auxiliary
power and are sufficient for the Akira’s needs.

Tactical: In 2361, HiBeam Energies was contracted to extend the capabilities of the venerable FH-11 phaser system, a weapon that
had been in the Starfleet inventory for over 80 years. The plan called for a reduction in the systems mass by miniaturizing several
older assemblies, a 25% increase in phaser accuracy at short ranges and a 50% increase in beam cohesion out to 150,000 kilometers.
Coupled with the same FP-10 torpedo system mounted aboard the Nebula-class, the Akira is a formidable foe on the battlefield.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: While only marginally smaller than the Nebula-class, the Akira sports a comparable crew size
and a provision for civilians. With a design emphasis is on fleet operations and border duty, the vessel can expect to be away from port
for months at a time. To counter this, the Akira has been fit with generous shipboard recreational and educational facilities. The
computer systems are the same type developed for the Galaxy-class with starships launched after 2375 receiving bioneural processors
for some of her primary computing needs.

Development and Construction History: Of the fifty Akira-class starships built, twenty-eight remain in active service. Heavy losses
in the Dominion war led to the cancellation of new constructs in 2376, but those casualties are mostly attributed to the Akira’s
prominence in that conflict and not due to any design defect. Construction took place at the Utopia Planitia, Shar Ta’kel, San
Francisco, Antares and Chandley Works shipyards from 2360 through 2380.

    The beginning of the Ambassador-class project in 2315 heralded the beginning of a new design philosophy for Starfleet. It was the
first attempt to turn away from large numbers of mission specific ships to fewer, larger and more capable multimission starships.
With an emphasis on range, flexibility, durability and firepower, the Ambassador was as revolutionary as the commissioning of the
HMS Dreadnought by the United Kingdom on Earth in the early 20th century. Intended to take over many of the exploratory and
diplomatic functions of the successful Excelsior-class, the Ambassador has proven itself in every way a starship can. In the half
century since they entered service, the Ambassador class has explored hundreds of worlds, pushed back the boundaries of Federation
space, fought in countless regional conflicts and was the inspiration for two new ship designs, the Rigel and Springfield-class
starships.

Classification: Although today she would certainly be commissioned as an Exploration Cruiser, the nomenclature of the time of her
commissioning designated the Ambassador as a cruiser.



                                                                54

Design: With a few notable exceptions, Starfleet had designed into its previous vessels a design life measured in decades. With the
Ambassadors, their cost and mission scope dictated a 100 year life span with major system upgrades at 20 year intervals. This
expandability was built into the design with ample room for new sensors, crew facilities, lab space and advanced propulsion systems.
In fact, when the USS Ambassador launched in 2327, only 80% of her habitable internal volume was in use. For future ship designs,
this new construction philosophy would soon become the norm. The structural layout of the Ambassador-class is the traditional
saucer/engineering hull/twin nacelle arrangement found on many starship designs of the last century. The Ambassador is equipped
with a saucer separation capability, but reconnecting requires the facilities of a starbase or repair tender. This provision is purely an
emergency procedure and has only been performed once in the life span of the design.

Engineering: The Ambassador utilizes an improved version of the FIWA-1 (Federation-Improved Warp drive type A/1) for its main
propulsion. Capable of driving the vessel at emergency speeds of up to warp 9.3 or a cruising speed of warp 6, the vessel was quite
fast for its day. The FIH-2 impulse reactor is a derivative of the unit used in the successful Apollo-class of the years before and is
ample for the ship’s needs.

Tactical: The Ambassador-class sports a tactical system that is impressive by even today’s standards. Ten collimated FH-10 phaser
arrays cover the vessel from virtually every angle along with twin fore and aft torpedo launchers. The shielding of the time was the
advanced FSS-2 array, a derivative of the system used aboard the Excelsior-class. Minor hardware and software upgrades developed
from technology spawned from the Galaxy-class project allowed a 50% increase in shield efficiency starting with refits in 2361. This
more than anything has allowed the Ambassador to remain an integral part of the fleet decades after the first unit was produced.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: For a vessel who’s volume approaches that of the celebrated Galaxy-class with only 75% of the
crew requirement, the Ambassador is a comfortable starship. With long range exploration missions in mind, crew amenities were
foremost in the designer’s priorities. When refits in the late 2350s and early 60s added holodecks to the Ambassadors along with
provisions for civilians, the added burden on the support systems was barely noticed, a testament to the forward thinking of the
vessel’s designers.

Development and Construction History: The Ambassador-class was designed at Starfleet Engineering, Terra with the initial three
units building at the San Francisco Fleet Yard in Earth orbit. Construction ran until 2376 when the last vessel of the class, the
USS Hornet, was commissioned. Construction took place at numerous facilities throughout the Federation with an emphasis on Sol
System facilities. Of the 38 units constructed, twenty remain in active service. One Ambassador, the Thalmaj, served as flagship of
the Andorian “Blue Fleet” until it was scrapped due to extensive damage inflicted by the Dominion at the Second Battle of Regelia.
Another, the USS Cassini continues a Starfleet tradition by having a predominantly Vulcan crew.

     Flight 1 Ambassador-class starships: Ambassador-Enterprise First six vessels completed to initial design specs. Later refit to
     Block II and Block III specifications at 10 and 20 year intervals respectavely.

     Flight 2 Ambassador-class starships: Langley-Invincible Most numerous type of the Ambassador-class. Improvements
     include the first generation penta-transducing deflector shield system, an expanded crew compliment, a more powerful impulse
     drive and an improved sensor suite. Also sports an additional shuttlebay on the aft fantail and a new deflector array. All vessel
     of this type were refit to the Block III specifications during their scheduled 20 year upgrade cycle.

     Flight 3 Ambassador-class starships: Goliath-Discovery Sports advancements made during the Galaxy-class design project
     including an improved version of the FIWA-2 warp drive, the new FP-10 torpedo launcher, the FSS-M deflector shield system,
     and the most advanced lab and sensor facilities available.

     Flight 4 Ambassador-class starships: Exeter-Hornet Last Ambassador type in production. Fit with the modern FUWR-1 warp
     drive, larger fuel tanks and an exploration capability second only to the Galaxy-class. Further equipped with a hybrid
     bioneural/isolinear computer system to take up the processing loads required from the new drive system and sensor suite.

Andor-class Missile Cruiser




   Since their introduction in 2272, the Andor-class missile cruiser has captured the hearts and minds of their crews for their handling
characteristics and offensive firepower. Fielded in a time when photon torpedo technology was just coming into its own, the Andor
stood as the defender of Starfleet interests and Federation security until their retirement en-masse in the mid-2310s. When the fleet
was desperate for offensive firepower at the height of the war with the Dominion, the Andor was the logical choice for modernization
and reactivation. Further, it is no surprise that upon the cessation of hostilities in 2375 that Starfleet chose to retain part of the Andor
fleet to make up for wartime losses.

Nomenclature: Although they were originally commissioned with proper names and registries, this publication has chosen to omit
them, as their inclusion would be impractical.

Classification: The Andor was originally designated as a cruiser in 2272, but their redesign one hundred years later changed that
classification to missile cruiser. This denotes that the vessel is primarily armed with torpedoes and utilizes her phasers only as a
backup weapon.

Design: The primary consideration in the design of the Andor was safety and speed. Her warp nacelles are well protected by their
structural support pylons and are mounted close together and center aft of the main hull. The wing like structures on the port and
starboard sides of the vessel act not only as the nacelle supports but also as a crude type of armor for the primary hull. Her saucer
section is the type found on most vessels of the day with a small secondary hull housing the warp drive and fuel bunkers.

Engineering: Upon their reactivation in 2373, the Starfleet Engineers in charge of the refit project set their sites on integrating the
Andor with the new FUWE-1 warp drive. This lightweight and easily modified drive would increase the Andor’s top speed from a
paltry warp 8 to warp 9.5 with a cruising speed of warp 7. The addition of a second impulse drive further added to the Andor’s
maneuverability and helped push the vessel’s power reserves to 100% above what the first vessels of the class could expect upon
commissioning. Along with the new drive systems came a whole new structural integrity field generator scheme that helped to further
increases the Andor’s rigidity and durability during battle.

Tactical: The capabilities of the Andor’s primary armament have increased significantly in the last 100 years, and the inclusion of the
new FP-10 torpedo launchers into the refit vessels was never in doubt. Along with increased range, accuracy and yield came a 50%
increase in her rate of fire. Coupled with her heavy FH-11 phaser systems, the Andor was the perfect fleet escort cruiser or siege
weapon. During the Dominion war the Andor would most often be attached to the largest vessels of a task force with the express
purpose of shooting down incoming enemy torpedoes with her own impressive counter-battery capabilities.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: One of the priorities in the Andor’s refit process was the reduction of the vessel’s crew
requirements. Manpower shortages were taking their toll on the fleet and the last thing Starfleet needed to deal with was vessels idle
in spacedock merely because there was no one available to take them into battle. The answer was to automate as many of the Andor’s
maintenance and engineering systems as possible to reduce her personnel requirements. A hundred years of computer and automation
system advances allowed just that, and her crew compliment went from 240 to a mere 190. These wartime refits allowed for the
inclusion of few amenities and they are mostly devoid of luxuries. Fortunately the units that were retained for service were completed
to modern specifications in the years since and the crews are well accommodated. Her computer system was almost completely
removed and replaced with a much smaller but vastly more powerful isolinear based core with a hybrid bioneural backup for high-
speed performance.

Development and Construction History: The Andor’s originally entered service in 2278 with nearly 450 units eventually being
commissioned. Wartime and other losses accounted for 43 of the class’ numbers before a mass retirement starting in 2314 and ending
in 2318. Of those vessels, all but 100 were scrapped or sold to the Corillian States as surplus. Mothballed vessels were retained at
Memory Beta, the fleet's primary starship retirement and storage depot, a facility that was established in 2273. The Andors were then
maintained and inspected biannually to ensure their long term viability for future reactivation. When the call went out to reactivate
nearly 800 of the various vessels stored there for the war effort, the process was virtually effortless. The reactivations were mostly
handled in house at Memory Beta, but a number of special cases were farmed out to various fleet yards throughout the Federation.
The rate of reactivation was an average of five Andors per month with a turnaround time of three months. Even after the war the refits
continued for a time in order to bolster the reserve fleet and make up for wartime losses. With the post war downsizing the bulk of the
reactivated ships went back into mothballs or were sold to the Corillian States. Other ships that were too damaged or worn for salvage
were sent to the breakers yard. Even years after the cessation of hostilities thirty-seven Andor-class missile cruisers remain in active
service, thirty-four in the reserves with another twenty-five held in storage at Memory Beta.

   During the darkest days of the Dominion War, Starfleet was forced to reactivate hundreds of mothballed starships hulls, among
them, numerous Andor-class cruisers that had placed in reserve over 60 years before. After an extensive upgrade program brought
them up to minimal fleet specifications, Starfleet found that the old design still had a few tricks left in her, and the Andors were much
sought after fleet support assets. Post war downsizing reduced the number of Andors available, though outright obsolescence wasn’t
far behind. Starfleet had learned a lesson, and a call went out for a new fleet support missile cruiser to replace the Andor. Naturally,
the designers at Chiokis Fleet Yards (the original Andorian designer of the Andor-class) returned to their venerated elder design for
inspiration. After an extensive trial period, the first two Andor Storm-class missile cruiser entered fleet service.

Classification: The Andor Storm is designated as a missile cruiser, denoting that she utilizes a variety of photon torpedo technologies
as her tactical system.

Design: The Andor Storm is heavily based upon the older Andor-class cruiser of a century before, but in reality the two have very
little in common. The elongated saucer section if of a newer type that has been found to be more efficient at warp threshold
transitional acceleration and more fuel efficient than older designs. The vessel’s main body still provides a high degree of cover for
the warp nacelles, though the secondary hull was omitted entirely from the class.

Engineering: The FUWE-2 warp drive and twin FIF-2 impulse drives are standard for vessels of her mission profile and provide
ample power generation and maneuvering ability.

Tactical: The heart of the Andor Storm is her tactical array, and much thought went into the design before her deployment. In
answering the call for a fleet support missile cruiser, the vessel’s designers chose to orient the ship’s tactical array toward defense,
specifically, intercepting and destroying enemy torpedoes targeted at it or a fleet command ship. The FP-12 torpedo array fit aboard
the Andor Storm is the first new type to enter the field since the FQ-1 over a decade ago. By utilizing a new sub-space linked fire-and-
remember targeting system and warhead designed to fragment and disrupt enemy torpedoes, the FP-12 is a unique defensive asset.
The firing vessel’s tactical officer also has the option during the weapon’s pre-loader sequence to substitute a warhead that when
detonated is more efficient at disrupting targeting sensors than the older types. While these options have the net effect of rendering
the FP-12 less effective as an offensive weapon, its value as a fleet defender is incalculable.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The Andor Storm-class vessels are popular assignments thanks to the attention paid to crew
comforts and living space per crewmember. Most vessels with her mission profile have traditionally been fit with only the most basic
crew support systems, but the designers at Chiokis spared no expense for their new design. The computer system built into the Andor
Storm is a custom isolinear design specifically tailored to handle the processing demands of the FP-12 torpedo system’s targeting and
communications needs. As a result, the Andor Storm possesses a unique capacity for information transfer and can act as a fleet
command or sector wide communications hub should the need arise.

Development and Construction History: Of the five Andor Storm-class vessels built to date, all remain in active service.
Production will continue for the foreseeable future at a rate of three vessels per year. After the initial builds at Chiokis Fleet Yards
above Andor, production has been diversified throughout the Federation.

   The Andromeda came about in the early 2350s as a response to a need for medium range fire support cruisers for inter-Federation
defense missions. The Miranda and Apollo-class cruisers that had traditionally performed these functions were no longer adequate to
the task, and a replacement was needed. The Andromeda was a quick solution utilizing a proven hullform and powerful powerplant,
but her primary asset was ease of production. In reality, the Andromedas proved to be complex to maintain and too short ranged for
practical use in modern task force operations.

Classification: The Andromeda is classified as a tactical fire support cruiser.

Design: The primary hull is designed around a reengineered Ambassador-class saucer section with extensive modifications to her aft
sections and tactical systems. Twin nacelles rise above the primary hull from a structural hardpoint that encloses the horizontal
intermix chamber and fuel storage facilities. In an emergency the entire assembly can be ejected from the ship leaving the saucer to
maneuver on impulse power only.

Engineering: The FIWA-2 warp drive was improved to modern standards with the Mk IIs introduction in 2359. With the new drive
assembly, the Andromeda is capable of an impressive top speed of warp 9.65 for twelve hours with a cruising speed of warp 6. The
FIG-1 impulse drives provide adequate sublight maneuverability. Unfortunately her small fuel storage tanks require frequent
restocking and the Andromeda’s maximum cruising range is 2.5 years at warp 6, far below the fleet’s norm.

Tactical: The Andromeda’s impressive tactical systems are crowned with a quadruple mounting of the powerful FH-15 phaser
cannons that were made famous with the Galaxy-class. Early incarnations of the class carried a modified version of the FH-14 until
refits and software upgrades made the heavier systems available. The follow up FH-11 phaser array is not quite as powerful, but it
does round out the vessel’s coverage in the remaining arcs. Her FP-4 and later FP-10 torpedo array is a straight off copy of the type fit
aboard the Ambassador-class and provides an adequate rate of fire. The FSS-2a shield generators provide excellent protection against
threat forces with the vessel’s 25 man Marine contingent providing shipboard security or a minor landing force capability.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: For such a small vessel, the Andromeda is a very crowded starship. Her near seven hundred-
man compliment is packed into crew quarters so spartan that even many of the officers share a cabin. Only the senior staff enjoys the
luxury of a private suite, and even this is sometimes eliminated to take aboard mission specialists. The computer system is the same
type developed for the Galaxy-class and is ample for the vessel’s needs.

Development and Construction History: Of the fifteen Andromeda-class starships built to date, seven remain in active service.
Construction concluded in 2372 at Utopia Planitia with the commissioning of the USS Drake, and no further vessels of the class are
planned.




                                                                  61

           Flight 1 Andromeda-class starships: Andromeda-Gothos First five vessels fit to initial design specifications. Crew
           compliment aboard the USS Winchester reduced by 120 to increase the Marine compliment by twice that. All existing
           vessels refit to Mk II specifications at a rate of one per year starting in 2365.

           Flight 2 Andromeda-class starships: Diligent-Drake Type two Andromeda-class vessels developed to take advantage of
           the technologies coming out of the Galaxy-class development project. Primary phaser array changed to FH-15 standards.
           Torpedo launchers switched to the more versatile FP-10. Shields enhanced to FSS-2a specifications through minor
           hardware and software revisions. Structural support system enhanced through the addition of extra generators in the engine
           core assembly. Crew compliment aboard the USS Battan reduced by 120 to increase the Marine compliment by twice that.

On stardate 4/6803, the USS Centauri played host to peace talks between the Renari and the Pakdorn, two neighboring races who had
been at war for centuries over mining rights in a nearby asteroid cluster. The negotiations were into their fifth day when Federation
Ambassador and the talk’s arbitrator Susan Frease announced that several compromises had been agreed to and the terms of the treaty
would be announced within the day. However, factions on the Pakdorn side had other plans, and had managed to sneak aboard an
operative posing as one of their sides security contingent. The agent attempted to end the negotiations by rushing into the negotiations
with a thermalitic charge and detonating it in the middle of the proceedings. Fortunately, two Starfleet security officers detained him
outside the talks before he could gain entry. The Pakdorn bomber then fled the scene and attempted to gain access to main
engineering, presumably where he could destroy the warp core and hence, the entire vessel. However, he was stopped well short of
his target by the now alerted shipboard security and he was confined to an area near the primary deflector. With no other avenue of
escape, the bomber detonated his charge, which wrecked the deflector but caused little other damage thanks to several force fields that
contained the blast. In the end, the talks concluded with both sides agreeing to mining tonnage restrictions and an end to hostilities.
The Centauri would spend the next three weeks under repairs having her deflector and several other systems replaced.

On stardate 4/8001, the USS Hubble took part in a raid on a Borg outpost in the first ever offensive operation against the powerful foe.
The small outpost had been discovered by a Romulan cruiser while surveying space near their border in Beta Quadrant. The Hubble,
along with the Heimdall-class Tiblisi and the Algeron-class RSV Haazakara planned a two-fold attack against the Borg facility. First,
the Tiblisi would move into orbit to get the attention of the outposts sentry vessels and draw them off. Then, the Hubble and
Haazakara would move in, board the facility, take as much technology and information they could carry and set demolition charges.
The plan worked flawlessly, and the Marine contingent from the Hubble and several security operatives from the Romulan side
gathered a wealth of information before evacuating. For the Borg, nearly 12,000 drones were destroyed in the attack with no losses to
the coalition force. The information gained from the operation was shared between the two powers to help develop a defense against
the Borg.

    The Apollo-class project came about in 2305 as an attempt to improve upon the already successful Excelsior-class battlecruiser, the
first such attempt to do so. Working out of the Shar Ta'kel Central Docks above 40 Eridani, the Vulcan engineers in charge of the
redesign were able to pick and choose the aspects of the Excelsior that would fit best into her new role and discard the dead weight.
Initial plans called for a total reworking of the vessel’s tactical systems and the inclusion of a radical new impulse drive to increase her
power reserves. Later in the construction stage, the Apollo was reworked to act as a lighter counterpart to the expected Renown-class
battlecruiser, a vessel that was then in the design phase but would later see only a limited production.

Classification: The Apollo-class is designated as a cruiser.

Design: Working from the hull of an incomplete type II Excelsior-class battlecruiser, the Apollo’s engineers focused on lowering the
vessel’s target profile and increasing her structural integrity. First, the connecting dorsal running from the secondary hull to the
primary hull was removed with the lost lab space being relocated to the engineering hull or eliminated altogether. Next, the nacelle
pylons were reoriented directly outboard of the primary hull to provide them with greater protection from the front and lower the
vessel’s sensor returns. The end result was a sleek streamlined vessel that honored the look and feel or the original Excelsior but
clearly went a step in its own direction. The tradeoff was a marked decrease in the efficiency of the Apollo’s bussard collectors, but
expanding the vessels fuel reserves by 15% has offset this minor defect.

Engineering: While the FIWA-1 warp drive was a straight copy from the unit fit aboard the Excelsior, her impulse drive arrangement
was another matter. For a number of years fusion reactor design advances had stagnated with the advent of the FIG series. It wasn’t
until the FIH-1 that the drive barrier was broken with the drive’s integration with a set of space-time driver coils in the thruster
segments. Difficult to maintain at first, the drive would not be perfected until 2324 when it was redesigned for the Ambassador-class
project. Eventually all previously fielded vessels were refit to the new specifications.

Tactical: The weapons systems fit aboard the Apollo are a clear departure from the type developed for the Excelsior-class. As a
primary assault weapon, the Apollo incorporates the first fielding of the FH-14 collimated phaser array, a heavy hitting if not short
ranged system with serious targeting problems. Her backup FH-10 array is better at close ranges with impressive reliability out to
40,000 kilometers. Her FP-4 torpedo system featured the highest rate of fire available for the time and became a mainstay aboard the
Ambassador-class in the years to come.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The crew compliment aboard the Apollo is well appointed thanks to her low manpower
requirements. With a habitable internal volume comparable with an Excelsior-class vessel with only 75% of her population, the
Apollo can afford to incorporate the latest in recreational and holodeck facilities. The computer core aboard ship is the same type
developed for the Excelsior and is adequate for the vessel’s needs.

Development and Construction History: Of the nineteen Apollo-class vessels constructed, ten remain in active service. One, the
USS Gage, was destroyed by the Borg at the Battle of Wolf 359. Constructed ended in 2336 with the commissioning of the USS
Socrates at the Seskon Trella fleet yards above Tellar.

           Acropolis One of 98 Seventh Fleet ships destroyed by the Jem’hadar in an attack against a Dominion communications
                     array in the Argolis Cluster on 4/7402.
           Triton    Destroyed by the Borg at the Typhon on stardate 4/7305.
           Socrates One of 98 Seventh Fleet ships destroyed by the Jem’hadar in an attack against a Dominion communications
                     array in the Argolis Cluster on 4/7402.

On stardate 4/4501.11, the USS Ulysses was patrolling the Triangle region for pirate activity when she received a distress call from
the merchantman SS Thostis, an Andorian flagged bulk freighter. The Ulysses set out at top speed to intercept the cargo vessel which
was reporting that it was caught in a massive gravitational distortion. The Ulysses arrived on scene to find the Thostis being ripped
apart by an unseen force and moved in to assist the doomed vessel. Records from a nearby passenger ship showed that the Ulysses
approached the freighter with the intention of docking since the transporters had no hope of operating in the wildly fluctuating
gravametric interference. Records further showed that the Ulysses tried to initiate a tractor beam to pull the two vessels together, but
something went terribly wrong. A subspace rupture opened at the terminus of the Ulysses’ tractor beam sheering the Thostis in half
and dragged the Federation vessel inside, never to be seen again. At the same moment, the gravitational distortion ceased and the
passenger ferry was able to pick up three survivors from the freighter. No sign of the Ulysses was ever found, and she has since been
declared lost, presumed destroyed.

On stardate 4/7403.12, the USS Bremerton detected an unidentified vessel moving at high warp away from the Dominion front and
into Federation space. Suspecting a surprise raid, the Bremerton and her two escorting destroyers moved to intercept the rogue vessel.
However, instead of finding a Cardassian or Jem’hadar warship they found the USS Erebus, a vessel that had been listed as destroyed
in fighting near the Kakarn system the week before. Upon refusal of hails and other attempts to stop her, the Bremerton used the conn
code override option to bring the wayward vessel to a stop. Once aboard, the Bremerton’s crew found that the Erebus was a dead
ship, he crew long since killed when their inertial dampening system was crippled in a battle against a Jem’hadar cruiser. Records
further showed that the Erebus continued on her own under automatic pilot until her preset course took her back into Federation space.
The Erebus was later towed back to a starbase where she was repaired and pressed back into service.

The Corillian States’ struggle for freedom from their oppressive Romulan masters is a well-documented and much debated topic
within the Federation. The methods utilized by the Corillians to free their enslaved brothers have been called a necessary evil by those
in favor of freedom at any price and outright terrorism by more restrained factions. Support within the Federation has always favored
the arming of the new Corillian homeworld to encourage self-reliance and an economic partnership to promote growth. However,
there are those on Corillia Prime who feel that the Federation’s stance is not enough and would seek to further draw Starfleet into the
conflict. On stardate 4/7203.11, the USS Agenor was delivering medical supplies to the Corillian starbase in the Regaran System.
While there the crew was able to enjoy the shore facilities of the modern base after a long trip from Federation space. On the second
day of shore leave, a group of twelve Corillians calling themselves the Shining Path Liberators snuck aboard the Agenor and seized
control. After forcing the skeleton crew off the ship, the freedom fighters beamed aboard a further 220 supporters from a nearby
transport and fled the facility. The illegally appropriated vessel then began to indiscriminately attack Romulan shipping and outposts
hoping to provoke a response by the Empire against the Federation. Instead, the Romulans and Starfleet worked together to lay a trap
for the Agenor and captured her intact after a skirmish near the Raven system. The Corillian terrorists were turned over for trial in the
Federation for their crimes after a short custody dispute that was eventually arbitrated by a neutral mediator.

   After a forty-year building trend had flooded the fleet with large multimission starships, Starfleet Engineering began to look to
smaller designs that were cost efficient and easier to build than the massive exploration cruisers. One of the first in this generation of
small, fast and heavily armed vessels was the Bradbury, a fairly successful design that would ultimately lead to the development of the
Intrepid, an altogether impressive vessel. While the Bradbury was in many respects a disappointment due to her poor maneuverability
and high maintenance primary systems, she led the way in a revolution that would begin to bolster Starfleet’s dwindling numbers.

Classification: The Bradbury is classified as a long-range tactical cruiser.

Design: The Bradbury sports a more angular version of the familiar Starfleet saucer section that not only provides a more streamlined
look for the vessel but allows more efficient warp field layering at high speeds. The small secondary hull blends into the saucer
almost seamlessly and encases the vessels engineering sections, fuel storage bunkers and shuttle bay, an arrangement common to the
fleet. Her long elegant nacelles are mounted to the side and parallel with the saucer section to not only provide them an extra measure
of protection but to lower the vessel’s fore and flank target profiles.

Engineering: The warp drive mounted aboard the Bradbury is the same type developed for the Akira-class. Although it provides an
impressive top speed of warp 9.6 the ship is incredibly heavy and slow at sublight speeds. Even the drives weight reducing
space/time driver coil assembly can not help offset the vessel’s poor maneuverability. The Bradbury’s twin FIG-2 impulse drives are
simply unable to deal with the vessel’s mass and have been her undoing in several engagements.

Tactical: The Bradbury was able to take advantage of a new phaser system being developed for the Akira-class. The FH-16 is an
improvement over the venerable FH-11 array that had been in Starfleet service for nearly a century. Its miniaturized components and
long range made it perfect for deployment aboard the Bradbury. The Bradbury also took advantage of the new high capacity FP-10
torpedo launchers that had been introduced in the Galaxy-class a few years before. Her FSS-M shield system is another Galaxy-class
innovation integrated into the Bradbury and has proven itself to be a fine match.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The crew of the Bradbury is very well appointed with personal living space aboard ship nearly
25% larger than that available aboard a Galaxy or Ambassador-class vessel. She incorporates numerous recreational facilities for the
crew’s enjoyment on her long exploration missions and was one of the first new vessels designed with holodeck technology in mind.
The computer system aboard the Bradbury is a modified version of the type developed for the Galaxy and initially proved itself to be
inadequate due to her sensor suite’s requirements. However, the addition of bioneural processors in recent years has alleviated these
concerns.

Development and Construction History: Of the twelve Bradbury-class starships constructed, seven remain in active service.
Production ended in 2377 at Utopia Planitia and no further vessels of the class are planned.

The Cheyenne-class starship was envisioned in the early 2350s as the great new hope for Starfleet’s exploration service. While it was
widely felt that the Galaxy-class would be leading this endeavor, it would not be doing so in any great numbers for several years.
Starfleet wanted a supplementary vessel to take over the duties of the aging and near obsolete Oberth and Constellation-class starships
and carry the flag of the Federation farther than any had done so to date. While the Cheyenne has proven to be an invaluable explorer
and all around well designed cruiser, her rate of production never reached the levels necessary to take over Starfleet’s research efforts
as had been originally intended.

Classification: The Cheyenne is designated as a long range tactical explorer with a secondary role of heavy scout.

Design: The Cheyenne utilizes a reengineered version of the saucer section designed for the New Orleans-class with twin
superstructures rising from the dorsal and ventral sides of the vessel. From them, two sets of warp nacelles jut out and away from the
hull to generate a massive and complexly layered warp field around the hull. With the complicated engine arrangement, it was felt
early on in the vessel’s construction that a provision for separated flight mode was called for, and was subsequently built into the
class. Separated, the star drive is largely unmaneuverable except for thruster power and the saucer section becomes nothing more than
a life boat, but this feature adds a measure of safety for her crew.

Engineering: Twin FUWE-2 warp cores power the four nacelles either in tandem or one at a time. With both cores at full power, the
vessel can maintain warp 9.75 for twelve hours or warp 9.45 for 30 hours with a standard cruising speed of warp six. With one core
running and at least one set of nacelles powered the vessel can maintain warp 8 for fifteen hours or a cruising speed of warp 5.
The FIF-3 impulse drives mounted in the saucer are small but sufficient for the ship’s needs.

Tactical: The Cheyenne mounts an impressive array of triple banked FH-15 phasers that cover the vessel quite efficiently. The FP-10
torpedo tubes also cover the vessel from the fore and aft positions and are still considered state of the art.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The Cheyenne is a comfortable vessel with a low crew compliment and extensive recreational
facilities. Her sensor suite is second to none and the Cheyenne’s are considered prime assignments for researchers and scientists. The
computer core if a modified version of the type built for the Galaxy-class and is suitable for the vessel’s mission scope.

Development and Construction History: Of the ten Cheyenne-class starships built, seven remain in active service. Construction
concluded in 2370 at Utopia Planitia with the introduction of the Intrepid-class starship, a design destined to replace the difficult to
built Cheyenne.

Historical Notes:
                Cheyenne        Destroyed by forces of the Kekrim Imperium in Bata Quadrant on stardate 4/6708.

   The Constellation-class heavy cruiser program was began in the early 2370s as a complimentary starship class for the upcoming
Excelsior. Starfleet was also in need of a new long-range explorer to replace the aging Constitution-class, a venerable design that was
reaching the end of her construction run. The “Conny,” as she is widely known, was built with the express purpose of very deep space
exploration and research with an average eight year span between port visits, a time period far outpacing anything previously built.
Over the past century the Constellations have proven to be capable explorers and have more than lived up to the expectations of her
designers.

Classification: The Constellation is classified as a heavy cruiser, a designation that is no longer in use with Starfleet.

Design: To the casual observer, the Constellation would appear to be no more than the salvaged saucer section of a Constitution-class
starship with four nacelles tacked on. In fact, the saucer is a custom design to incorporate the fuel supply, consumables and
shuttlecraft necessary for deep space missions. Furthermore, the primary hull was designed to incorporate mission specific sensor
pallets and modular lab spaces for mission flexibility.

Engineering: The engine arrangement is a fairly novel setup designed to maximize the vessel’s survivability in a hostile deep space
environment. Instead of mounting just the single traditional warp core, the Constellation mounts two with both synchronized to power
a single set of nacelles. With both cores at full power, the vessel can maintain warp 9.2 for twelve hours or warp 8.8 for 30 hours with
a standard cruising speed of warp six. With one core running and at least one set of nacelles powered the vessel can maintain warp 8
for fifteen hours or a cruising speed of warp 5. This revolutionary setup allows the vessel to suffer the loss of one warp core and still
have the ability to make its way home on its own power in the event of an emergency. The Constellation’s impulse arrangement is not
quite as impressive however, and she has been sited for decades as being too sluggish at impulse velocities. Starting with the Mk III
refits in 2368, the entire engine suite has been redesigned to modern specifications, and for the first time in their histories the
Constellations possess an acceptable top warp speed as well as ample maneuvering power.

Tactical: Early version of the Constellation mounted the short range FH-13 phaser array and later the more powerful FH-14. Her
torpedo armament was fairly impressive for her day with tubes covering all approach angles simultaneously. For a vessel designed for
deep space operations, the Constellation was a fairly heavily gunned starship, but she lacks the maneuverability to take advantage of
her firepower.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The crew requirements for a Constellation are fairly loose and the small compliment is well
appointed aboard ship. The vessel’s recreational systems are still fairly advanced and the recent inclusion of holodecks and other
modern amenities has greatly improved crew morale. The initial duotronic computer systems fit aboard the Constellations were
quickly replaced with an isolinear array in the early 2300s and remains the standard for the Constellations to this day.

Development and Construction History: Of the forty-three Constellation-class heavy cruiser constructed, eight remain in active
service with one, the USS Hathaway serving in the training command. Two of the class, the Indiri and the Tarus, were destroyed by
the Borg at the Battle of Wolf 359.

           Flight 1 Constellation-class starships
           Constellation-Daystrom Initial production run fit to design specifications with few changes over the forty-six year
           production run. Computer systems changed over to the Type 1 isolinear array in 2293 with all previous vessels upgraded
           to new standards within three years.

           Flight 2 Constellation-class starships
           Izar-Noble Planned eight vessel production run reduced to four after budget cutbacks. Last four hulls mothballed at 24%-
           37% completion. New specifications included a heavier phaser array, improved shielding, extra torpedo coverage, a
           completely new sensor suite and impulse reactors. All active vessels refit to new specifications within twenty years.

           Flight 3 Constellation-class starships
           Indiri II – Tarus II Last four incomplete hulls pulled out of mothballs in 2368 for completion to new specifications.
           Four mothballed vessels also reactivated and refit as a response to losses to the Borg at Wolf 359. All primary systems
           thoroughly modernized. These are among some of the longest ranged vessels in the fleet and are expected to remain in
           active service for at least 80 years.

In 2311, the Federation was on the verge of declaring peace with the very adversary she had fought a bloody war with only 150 years
before. For the first time, the Romulans were at the negotiation table and the talks were going quite well. At the time, peace with the
Klingons was if not assured, then at least in sight. An alliance with the Romulans would not only insure security for the whole of the
Alpha Quadrant, but also bring peace to the entire region. After three years of talks, the Romulans were finally ready to strike a deal
that would include not only an alliance, but would tear down the Neutral Zone that had separated the two parties for so long. The
benefits of open trade and cultural exchange were already being seen as the next great hope for the Federation. However, there were
factions within the Roulan government, specifically the Tal’shiar that violently opposed the alliance. Although their voice was a
minority, there were those that saw the removal of the Neutral Zone and the freeing of Corillia a threat to their very way of life. On
stardate 4/1108.02, this minority acted in the bloodiest manner they knew how. On Remus, Romulan Praetor Tszosa was assassinated
by his own guards after being paid off by the Tal’shiar. At Camp Tomed near the Neutral Zone, the Federation and Romulan fleets
were meeting to finalize the agreement. From out of nowhere, ten Warbirds decloaked and began firing into the Federation and
Romulan Fleets. The Romulans, not realizing that they were under attack by their own people, joined the fight against the Starfleet
vessels. The slaughter spread to the talks on the planet as Romulan ground troops rounded up the diplomatic delegation and executed
the entire party, Romulan and Federation alike. Of the ten Starfleet vessels present at the talks, only one made it back to Federation
space intact. The total loss of life for the Federation was 85 negotiators on the ground and 4227 Starfleet personnel in the ships in
orbit. Among the ships lost was the Constellation-class Cochrane, the Excelsior-class USS Yamato, the dreadnought USS West
Virginia and numerous other vessels. In the Romulan coup, nearly 10,000 citizens of the Empire lost their lives as the pro-isolationist
Praetor Makara came into power for the next five decades. The incident at Tomed would be the Federation’s last formal contact with
the Empire until 2364.

In the early 2380s, a decision was made to retire the remaining Mk II Constellation-class vessels over a five year period. Losses
during the 2370s had finally brought home the vulnerability of the aged design, and newer vessels such as the Frontier, Majestic, Luna
and Nova were finally spearheading Starfleet’s exploration efforts. The recently fielded Mk III-class Constellations have been
retained for service and are still considered to be state of the art.

  The Freedom-class starship has been called a contradiction with a warp core. Too large to be a cruiser, too undergunned to be a
destroyer. Too fast to be a frigate but too slow to be a scout, she was a single nacelle starship in a time when two nacelles were the
norm. Her early years are steeped in a drawn out and over budget construction with the first commissioned unit almost being the last.
However, production continued and the Freedom soon went on to become a valued member of the fleet.

Classification: The Freedom is currently designated as a cruiser, although her mission profile is that of a heavy scout of light cruiser.

Design: The saucer section is a simple ellipsoid with a support pylon bracing a single warp nacelle. The pylon also serves as the
housing for the vertical warp intermix chamber and torpedo launchers to save room in the primary hull.

Engineering: The FIWA-2 warp drive powers the single nacelle for an impressive top speed of warp 9.75, a revolution for her day.
However, she is able to maintain these speeds for only six hours, good for a high speed sprint but not enough for most scouting
missions. Her duel FIG-4 impulse drives provide superb auxiliary power generation and sublight maneuverability.

Tactical: The Freedom’s primary strength is in her rapid fire FH-10 phaser array. This system allows the Freedom to overwhelm an
enemies shields with multiple volleys in a manner unmatched until the Defiant-class of the mid-2360s. Unfortunately, her FP-4
torpedo launchers are not nearly as powerful and suffer from a low rate of fire.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The Freedom’s complicated engine arrangement makes the vessel fairly manpower intensive
and these ships are unusually crowded. However, her wildly varying mission profile means that crewmembers get experience in a
wide assortment of fields, and assignment to a Freedom-class vessel is considered a fast track to promotion. The computer system
aboard ship is a unique isolinear/forced quantum matrix array and is fit only with the Freedom-class vessels. This more than anything
led to the long development and shakedown periods of early vessels of the class. Vessels built after 2345 are equipped with a
standard isolinear makeup.

Development and Construction History: Of the fourteen Freedom-class vessels constructed, six remain in active service with two,
the USS Firebrand and USS Liberator lost to the Borg at Wolf 359.

   Like the Bradbury-class that came before her, the Intrepid was designed as a long range tactical cruiser to act not only in the
defense of Federation interests but to help explore the most far flung reaches of known space. To this end, the Intrepid can be called
the success story of the two vessels, a clear winner in the race to develop the fastest and most rugged vessel possible. The Intrepid
was developed at Utopia Planitia as a part of the fleet’s attempt to build a vessel specifically to counter the threat posed by the Borg,
and the design clearly exhibits many of the advancement that came out of the project. In the years since her introduction the Intrepid
has demonstrated time and again in countless situations to be one of the all around finest vessels ever developed.

Classification: The Intrepid is classified as a long-range tactical cruiser with a secondary emphasis on missions of exploration and
research. Although she is not nearly as well staffed as some of the larger pure science vessels or exploration cruisers she performs
both duties with distinction.

Design: One look at the Intrepid is enough to convince even the casual observer that the ship is quite different from anything
developed by Starfleet in decades. Her teardrop shaped primary hull was designed to push through subspace wavefronts and
disperse the force of incoming shock waves. Although her secondary hull is a fairly common design, her engine arrangement is
anything but. The Intrepid-class is the first vessel to incorporate variable geometry nacelles as a part of a program to reduce the
effects of “warp speed pollution” in the fabric of space. The nacelles also have the effect of dynamically refining the Intrepid’s
acceleration curve from sublight to warp speeds making her one of the fastest vessels in the fleet.

Engineering: For primary propulsion the Intrepid-class designers chose to incorporate the new FUWR-2 warp drive. Light, efficient
and easy to maintain, the drive can propel the Intrepid at speeds in excess of warp 9.975 for up to twelve hours with a cruising speed
of warp 7. Secondary propulsion is provided by two FIG-1impulse drives imbedded in the nacelle support pylons. By positioning the
two drives far apart on the vessel’s Y-axis the Intrepid is capable of some impressive high speed maneuvering by utilizing thrust
vectoring or differential thrust output. The Intrepid is also one of the largest vessels ever produced with the capacity to land on and
take off from planetary bodies up to 1.3Gs. The landing gear is stowed in a retracted position in the secondary hull until needed in
four recessed bays. The vessel’s weight distribution is such that upon landing several large anti-gravity plates in the primary hull
switch on to provide stability to the vessel while on a planets surface. Due to the loads placed on the vessel’s spaceframe while on a
planet’s surface the SIF generators must be in operation at all times to provide rigidity to the ship’s hull and prevent its collapse.

Tactical: Although the Intrepid’s FH-10 phaser array is not quite as powerful as several of the newer designs fielded in recent years,
their sheer numbers aboard the ship more than make up for any shortcomings. The phaser array covers every conceivable approach
angle an attacker could use to get at the Intrepid making her one of the most well protected vessels in the fleet. Unfortunately, space



                                                                   77

constraints limit the vessels rate of fire with her fore/aft torpedo launchers making it the only disappointing aspect of the vessel’s
tactical makeup. Her shield generator system is a direct result of the newer designs coming out of Borg Tactical and is one of the
strongest type currently in use by the fleet.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: For a vessel of the Intrepid’s size, her crew compliment is virtually minuscule compared to
other vessels of the same proportions. The crew enjoys some of the largest and most comfortable living suites in the fleet with access
to the most modern recreational facilities in service. Assignment to an Intrepid-class vessel is considered to be a prestige posting and
the waiting list for assignment to one is as long as for some of the larger explorer type vessels. The Intrepid was the first vessel
designed around the bioneural processing system, a computer type that incorporates an organic compound for ultra-fast computer
response times. This more than anything contributes to the vessel’s outstanding handling and response characteristics.

Development and Construction History: Of the eighteen Intrepid-class vessels constructed to date, fourteen remain in active
service. Construction is expected to continue for the foreseeable future at a rate of one per year with production taking place largely at
the Utopia Planitia and Sol III shipyards. Ships of the class are named for early deep space surveyor probes of the late 20th to early
21st centuries.

                          terrorists on stardate 4/7106. Contact temporarily reestablished on stardate 4/7406 after it was discovered
                          that Voyager was pulled into the Delta Quadrant by an unknown alien entity. Contact permanently
                          reestablished on stardate 4/7605 by the Pathfinder Project at Starfleet Headquarters, San Francisco, Terra.
                          Retired and placed on permanent display in San Francisco upon her return to the Alpha Quadrant in 2378.

                          stardate 4/7311.
           Nomad          Destroyed by Cardassian forces while patrolling near the Cardassian front on stardate 4/7502.
           Viking         Destroyed near Galorndon Core in an attack against a massed Romulan fleet on stardate 4/7710.

   Starfleet’s mission of exploration as always superseded its secondary role of peacekeeper. All vessels no matter what their makeup
are equipped for some sort of exploration capability, and this tradition has held true since the commissioning of the Daedalus-class
two centuries before. However, the Istanbul merely pays lip service to this notion and is purely a defensive asset used for inter-
Federation patrol duties and as a border tripwire. Although her sensor and electronic gathering systems are second to none, the
Istanbul is not much of a combat vessel and relies on her extreme contact range to avoid an engagement with the enemy.

Classification: The Istanbul is classified as a tactical support cruiser.

Design: The clear inspiration for the Istanbul’s design is the Excelsior-class starship, a capable class in its own right. However, the
Istanbul incorporates a massed sensor cluster system in the primary hull that extends from the ship’s keel to the top deck in places. To
allow the sensor arrays a clear line of site, the warp nacelles have been canted downward from their original position to the vessel’s
side. The structural changes needed to do this have served to strengthen the hull, a clear asset for any vessel.

Engineering: The FIWB-1 warp drive that has been included aboard the Istanbul is a sturdy design, but the new nacelle placement
slightly degrades their performance. With the warp field dynamics slightly off balance at all times, the Istanbul is only capable of
maintaining a top speed of warp 8.9 for twelve hours. The impulse drive arrangement is not much better with the twin FIG-1 fusion
reactors providing barely acceptable maneuverability at sublight speeds.

Tactical: At a first glance it appears that the Istanbul is a well armed vessel. However, it is clear once one look at her that the
weapons are purely defensive and very short ranged at that. Her FH-14 phaser systems have never been retrofit to the 14a standards
and her FP-9 torpedo launchers are unreliable at even moderate ranges. The Istanbul depends on her superior sensors to identify a
threat and disengage before a firefight ensues.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: Although she is comparable in size to an Excelsior-class vessel, the Istanbul’s crew
requirements are roughly two thirds of that vessel making her quite roomy. Although their recreational facilities are fairly limited, the
vessels of the class spend much of their time in port between missions giving the crew ample access to shore facilities. The computer
systems aboard ship are a modified version of the type developed for the Ambassador-class and are adequate for the high processor
demands placed by the sensor equipment.

Development and Construction History: Of the nine Istanbul-class vessels constructed only three remain in active service. Two of
the class, the Cyprus and Havana, were destroyed by the Borg at the Battle of Wolf 359.

Historical Notes:
           Cyprus      One of 39 vessels destroyed by the Borg at the Battle of Wolf 359 on stardate 4/6701.
           Malatya     Destroyed by Cardassian forces while patrolling near enemy territory on stardate 4/5803.
           Havana      One of 39 vessels destroyed by the Borg at the Battle of Wolf 359 on stardate 4/6701.
           Sarajavo    Reported lost, presumed destroyed while patrolling the Gamma Quadrant terminus of the Bajoran wormhole on
                       stardate 4/7105.
           Tasnaz      Reported lost, presumed destroyed while charting an unidentified subspace anomaly near Vulcan on stardate
                       4/4602.
           Ankara      Building suspended at 24% completion on stardate 4/3705 after the Istanbul construction project was canceled.
                       Building resumed on stardate 4/4001 in response to growing tensions with the Tholian Assembly. Destroyed in
                       action against Romulan forces in the Raven system on stardate 4/7610.

   The Korolev-class starship was conceived of during the builder’s trials of the USS New Orleans at the San Francisco Fleet Yards
above Terra. The contractor felt that the New Orleans hullform was a design with vast potential, and limiting her to a supporting role
was a waste of resources. The building contractor independently drew up plans to reshape the hull into a cruiser type starship with a
renewed emphasis on research facilities and a provision for civilian passengers. Starfleet Engineering enthusiastically approved the
plans, and the first Korolev-class starship went into production in February of 2350.

Classification: The Korolev is classified as a cruiser.

Design: The Korolev closely follow the external layout of the New Orleans-class frigate with a few notable exceptions. With the
removal of the Marine detachment, the three outrigger pods have been removed and their equipment moved inside the primary hull.
The nacelle pylons have been swept forward slightly to raise the efficiency of the warp field geometry and a phaser array was added to
the underside of the stardrive. The internal arrangement was reorganized accordingly to reflect these changes.

Engineering: The FIWB-1 warp drive was chosen for the Korolev for its sturdier construction and slightly better EPS flow
distribution over the FIWD-2 mounted on the New Orleans. However, the FIWB-1 provides only slightly better performance over the
New Orleans by providing a top warp speed of 9.3 for 12 hours with a cruising speed of warp 6. The FIG-1 impulse drive provides
the Korolev with sufficient maneuvering and auxiliary power.

Tactical: The FH-11 phaser system was retained for the Korolev and offers slightly better protection in from multiple approach
vectors. The FP-4 torpedo system was also modified to provide better cover in the forward arc with the remaining torpedoes covering
the flanks and aft. The FSR-3 shield system was kept as well and is satisfactory for the vessel’s needs.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: With her lowered crew requirements and exclusion of a Marine contingent, The Korolev is a
much more spacious and comfortable vessel than the New Orleans. Her mission of long range exploration and research requires
extended periods between starbase layovers, so recreational and entertainment facilities abound on the Korolev. The computer system
is identical to the one mounted aboard the New Orleans, and this was quickly realized to be a mistake. The increased demands put on
the core for research projects makes the system just barely sufficient, and the class has been upgraded numerous times over her
lifespan.

Development and Construction History: Of the ten Korolev-class starships built, only three remain in active service. No longer in
production, the Korolevs were built at numerous facilities throughout the Federation.

   The Mediterranean-class light cruiser came about in the early 2340s in response to a need for light utility vessels with decent
firepower and a heavy lift capability. In reality, the Mediterranean is more of a heavily armed freighter than anything else and has
been utilized successfully in that role for many years. Too lightly armed to be a warship and too short ranged to be an explorer, the
Mediterranean found its niche during the Dominion war in the mid-2370s. The class was found to be perfect for running planetary
blockades against besieged worlds to deliver much needed supplies and equipment to the forces on the surface. Although they are
capable vessels, modern freighters are too slow and under gunned for this type of duty. At the time, the Mediterranean seemed to be
made for the job.

Classification: The Mediterranean is classified as a light cruiser.

Design: For their new vessel, Starfleet Engineering clearly drew upon the Excelsior-class as the design basis for the Mediterranean.
The saucer section was redesigned to incorporate three cavernous cargo holds and a shuttle compliment to maneuver the bulky
equipment pallets. The engineering section and moderately sized fuel tanks were moved aft leaving the fore section to the living
quarters and modest recreational facilities.

Engineering: To lighten the ship as much as possible, the Mediterranean’s designers incorporated an older but proven warp drive for
primary propulsion. The FIWG-1 and her three nacelles are capable of a top speed of only warp 9.1, a low speed even at the time she
was developed. However, she can maintain that speed for thirty-six hours, three times that of a comparably sized vessel. With a
cruising speed of warp six and a very powerful impulse arrangement providing excellent maneuverability at sublight speeds the
Mediterranean is a nimble opponent. With the capability to perform such extended high-speed sprints it is easy to see why the
Mediterranean is a natural blockade-runner.

Tactical: The tactical array aboard the Mediterranean isn’t quite as impressive as her powerplant but it is adequate for most
operations. Her primary FH-14a array provides an impressive first strike option with backup FH-10 short-range phasers providing a
follow-up punch. Her fore and aft torpedo arrangement is light but adequate and is standard for vessels of the time.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: Although the crew compliment aboard the Mediterranean is fairly small, all of the space taken
up by storage space and other equipment makes for tight quarters. Fortunately, the vessels of the class spend a lot of time in port
between missions and the crew has the opportunity to take advantage of shore facilities quite often. The computer core aboard ship is
the enhanced version of the type developed for the Fletcher-class destroyer and is adequate for the vessel’s processing loads.

Development and Construction History: Of the nine Mediterranean-class vessels constructed, seven remain in active service.

  The Merced-class starships have been one of Starfleet’s quiet successes, an underrated yet immensely valuable heavy cruiser that
has served the fleet without fail for over forty years. Although she was built in a time that the Ambassador-class ruled supreme, the
Merceds blazed a path of exploration that serves as an example for even more capable starships to this day. Although she was never
considered to be one of the most advanced or powerful vessels ever built, she has stood on the front lines in the defense of the
Federation unwaveringly in over eight conflicts without a single loss, a testament to her designer’s vision.

Classification: If she were commissioned today, the Merced would undoubtedly be classified as an Exploration Cruiser. However,
the nomenclature of the time dictated that she be designated as a cruiser.

Design: The Merced follows the traditional twin nacelle, primary/secondary hull configuration familiar to most Federation starships
and shares many design aspects with the Alaska-class battlecruiser. The Alaska-class inspired combat oriented compartmentalization
and low EM emissions signature further increases the Merced’s value as a tactical cruiser. Although she is clearly outclassed by more
modern vessels, these and other classified systems make the Merced a valuable asset for any force commander.

Engineering: The Merced mounts the FIWB-1 warp drive, a powerplant that was in-vogue for starship designers in the 2330s – 2340s
for its ease of construction and hardy design. Capable of driving the vessel at speeds up to warp 9.3 for twelve hours or a cruising
speed of warp 6, the drive is efficient if not slightly dated by modern standards. A triple grouping of impulse drives aboard the Merced
became the inspiration for the arrangement used aboard the Galaxy-class, and is more then sufficient for the vessel’s needs.

Tactical: If firepower was the only yardstick for which a vessel was measured, then the Merced would certainly come out on top.
While the FH-10 phaser array may not be the most powerful in the fleet, the Merced mounts them in abundance and is a powerful
offensive strike cruiser. Her FP-4 torpedo suite is not quite as impressive with its low rate of fire, but this too has proven itself
adequate considering the Merced’s normal mission scope.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: A vessel as large as the Merced can expect to carry a large crew, a task that she is well suited
for. When the directive was given that families would now be a part of the standard compliment of starships, the Merced was one of
the first to be retrofit for their inclusion. Her crew support, recreational and educational facilities are among the best in the fleet and
reflect a leap forward in vessel designs intended to push out the boundaries of the Federation. Her computer core is the same type
developed for the Ambassador-class and has proven itself to be a worthy design.

Development and Construction History: Of the five Merced-class cruisers constructed, four remain in active service. One, the USS
Liverpool, was assigned to Starfleet Training Command in 2360. The Merceds were built at the Sol System and 40 Eridani fleet yards
between 2331 and 2358. There are no plans for further vessels of the class.

Historical Notes:
On stardate 4/5103.11, the USS Bristol was in an unenviable position. While patrolling the border with the IKS, the lone starship
detected a force of no less than thirty enemy vessels approaching Federation space. Included in the mix was at least seven T-12
assault transports, a clear sign that the renegade Klingons intended to land somewhere and stay for a while. While the bulk of the
enemy fleet was antiquated destroyers and barely operable cruisers they still posed a formidable threat for a single Federation starship.
With no time to spare and reinforcements days away, the Bristol equipped every shuttle and probe she had with sensor profile
enhancements and launched them to simulate a Federation fleet formation. The Bristol’s commanding officer, Captain (and for the
time being Admiral) Vadim Ivanov then hailed the approaching Klingon fleet and warned them off. To the Klingons their fleet was
evenly matched numerically, but according to their ancient sensors it was clearly outclassed by the advanced Federation technology.
The Klingon commander then turned course and returned to his own space having never even met the enemy in battle. For his actions,
Captain Ivanov was promoted to Admiral, this time for real, and was awarded the Andorian Battle Star.

   The Miranda-class starship has served with Starfleet over the last century as the fleets foremost multimission cruiser and
exploration vessel. A state of the art wonder when first introduced, the Miranda has quietly been moving into fleet support roles in
the last forty years as older units approach the end of their service lifetime. However, constant upgrades and the need to retain even
the oldest active vessels in light of losses to the Borg and Dominion have given the Miranda a new lease on life.

Classification: The Miranda is classified as a cruiser although she normally serves in a wide variety of roles.

Design: The Miranda came about while plans were being drawn up to refit the entire fleet of Constitution-class vessels en-mass. The
new technologies emerging from that project spurred the introduction of several new advanced starship designs, including the
Miranda. The Miranda’s layout was completely unique for her day and features the familiar saucer section with a greatly enlarged aft
section. Twin nacelles trail down and away from the hull instead of being prominently placed above the vessel. Her most innovative
feature is the “roll-bar” weapons pod that moves several of the bulkier sensor clusters and the fore/torpedo launchers out of the main
hull. This space saving feature allows the Miranda’s crew to enjoy fairly roomy habitable spaces in what would normally be a very
cramped design.

Engineering: Starting with the USS Selkirk in 2369, a massive effort began to thoroughly upgrade all active Miranda-class vessels to
extend their service life into the next century. Starting with the propulsion system, the engineers virtually rebuilt her primary systems
while revitalizing her tactical systems with more modern technology. The new FUWE-2 warp drive would increase the Miranda’s
maximum speed from a disappointing warp 9 to warp 9.2 sustainable for 12 hours.

Tactical: The 2369 refit cycle also saw the rebirth of the Miranda as a tactical support cruiser. Improvements to the Miranda’s SIF
grid and deflector shields increased her survivability in combat while the inclusion of the FH-15 pulse phaser array and FP-10 torpedo
launcher gave new life to her offensive punch. Although she is still far to lightly armed to participate effectively in modern fleet
engagements, the Miranda makes a formidable fleet escort and screening vessel.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: Duty aboard Miranda-class vessels is comfortable by most standards, and limited provisions
exist for the inclusion of families. Although her days of far reaching missions of exploration are behind them, the Miranda’s remain
to be well equipped for long duration patrol duties. Refits in the 2330s and 40s saw the replacement of the vessel’s old duotronic
computer core with a more efficient isolinear type which remains in use to his day.

Development and Construction History: Construction of the Miranda-class starships ended in 2340 with the commissioning of the
USS Volgoles at the San Francisco Fleet Yards. Of the 75 vessels of the class constructed, 23 remain in active service. Two, the
Atlantis and Saratoga were lost to the Borg at the Battle of Wolf 359.

   The Niagara-class cruiser has been called sited as the end result of engineers with too much time on their hands. Initial specs
called for a new medium cruiser capable of long-range exploration and advanced lab facilities. The designers at the San Francisco
Fleet Yards simply took the construction specs of the venerable Miranda-class, inverted the engine arrangement, replaced the weapons
pod with a large deflector dish and modernized the vessel’s systems. The Niagara was meant to fill the gap between the larger
missions too complicated for the Oberth-class science vessels to handle and the missions too trivial to divert an Ambassador-class
cruiser to investigate. Unfortunately, the Niagara suffered from a complicated building process and only a handful were ever
produced.

Classification: The Niagara is classified as a long-range research cruiser.

Design: The Miranda-class cruiser was clearly the primary inspiration for the Niagara’s design, but system wise the two share little
in common. The primary hull and aft deck layout is quite similar, but the reorientation and outright removal of several components is
clearly evident. The small deflector array has been moved to the rollbar pod and slung below the vessel with the torpedo launchers
being internalized in the saucer section fore area. The twin nacelles rise above and to the aft of the vessel in the exact opposite of the
Miranda, yet provide no better speed or acceleration than her progenitor.

Engineering: The FIWA-1 warp drive was heavily modified for inclusion aboard the Niagara due to its superb reliability and ease of
maintenance, a necessity for long-range missions of exploration. However, its initial top speed of warp 9.1 was a disappointment for
the project engineers. It wasn’t until the drives were fit to the FIUWA-1 standards in the late 2360s that the vessel achieved an
acceptable top speed of warp 9.4. Conversely, the twin FIG-2 impulse drives provide outstanding auxiliary power generation and
maneuvering at sublight speeds.

Tactical: The weapons array mounted aboard the Niagara is an impressive mix of heavy assault cannons and long-range defensive
arrays. The fore/aft mounted FH-14a phaser system provides a massive punch up close that remained unmatched until the advent of
the Galaxy-class. Her FH-10 array is better suited for standoff pinpoint attacks and harassing fire. The FP-4 torpedo array launches
from two fore mounted and one aft mounted tube providing a backup punch comparable to the Ambassador-class.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: Like any long-range explorer the Niagara is a well appointed vessel and is popular with her
crews. Her computer core is a standard isolinear makeup with recent bioneural enhancements.

Development and Construction History: Of the thirteen Niagara-class vessels constructed, four remain in active service with one in
the reserve fleet. The USS Princeton was lost to the Borg at the Battle of Wolf 359. Construction ended in 2354 with the
commissioning of the USS Amador at the Baikonur Cosmodrome at Terra, and no further units of the class are planned.

   Starfleet was at a crossroads in the early 2360s. The fleet was in the midst of an extensive modernization program that included the
mass retirement of several older classes of vessels and the fielding of numerous newer types. With the Galaxy-class in full production
but with limited availability, the exploration and defensive programs that the Federation relied on were, for the time being,
undermanned. One of the first designs approved to fill this gap was the Norway-class cruiser, a capable if not over-engineered
starship that has become an integral part of the fleet’s defense force.

Classification: The Norway is designated as a medium range tactical heavy cruiser.

Design: The Norway’s design is based around a simple wedge shaped primary hull with an aft mounted support section sporting two
nacelles parallel to the vessel’s centerline. While early testing of the basic hullform showed the design to be highly efficient for high
warp maneuvering and rapid warp field threshold transitional maneuvers, they failed to flesh out several structural flaws in the
vessel’s layout. The nacelle support pylons were soon found to be vulnerable to stress fracturing which could lead to a total structural
failure during high speed maneuvers. The fix for the problem added several years to the development project, but the issue was
eventually settled by adding several extra structural integrity field generators to key locations along the hull.

Engineering: The FUWR-2 warp drive fit aboard the Norway is an enhanced version of the type developed in the mid-2350s for the
Akira-class project. Light, powerful and sometimes tricky to maintain due to the Norway’s complicated EPS distribution layout, the
drive provides the Norway with an impressive top speed of warp 9.85 for twelve hours and a cruising speed of warp six. Added with
her twin FIG-3 impulse drives, the Norway is a powerful adversary at any speed.

Tactical: The Norway was one of the first vessels to leave Utopia Planitia with the new FH-18 heavy phaser array, a design that
improves upon the emitter segments designed for the Galaxy-class. Combined with a longer ranged version of the venerable FH-10
and the FP-10 torpedo launcher the Norway is one of the most heavily armed cruisers in the fleet.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: By modern standards, the Norway-class vessels are very crowded due to her labor intensive
primary systems. Although she does incorporate the latest in holodeck technology and other recreational facilities, the lack of living
space is a major drawback. The Norway’s computer system is the standard isolinear type and is adequate for the vessel’s needs.

Development and Construction History: Of the twenty-four Norway-class vessels built to date, eighteen remain in active service.
Construction continues at reduced levels at several facilities throughout the Federation with current plans calling for continued
production at a rate of one per year until 2386.

The Romulan Free States have been a thorn in the sides for not only the Federation but the Romulan Empire for the last seventy years.
Analogous to the Imperial Klingon States (IKS), the RFS came about as a government in exile after the coup that led to the Tomed
Incident and subsequent realignment of the Romulan power structure. Led by Admiral Tosh Tprel and his loyal M’pera Fleet, the
RFS receives only moderately disinterested support from the Romulan homeworlds. The RFS is equally uninterested in internal
Romulan politics and chooses to promote its own ascension as the second coming of the true Romulan Empire. The RFS’s inherent
distrust of the Federation and uneasy alliance with the IKS makes them a dangerous foe. One of the primary goals of the IKS/RFS
alliance is to destabilize the Triangle region and the bordering worlds of the three major powers that surround the neutral territory.
Their ultimate goal is to conquer the resource rich region and establish a new jointly ruled empire for the benefit of their followers.
The power struggle in the region is a web of mixed alliances, counter treaties and old loyalties gone astray. For the Federation, the
Corillian States was established as the new homeworld for the Corillian race, a group that started their existence in Romulan space but
had fled over the centuries when their planet was invaded and enslaved. The Romulans oppose them for their sometimes violent
attempts to free their enslaved brothers and the Klingons just barely tolerate them thanks to their alliance with the Federation. The
IKS has a similar history to the IKS but gained a massive boost in stature and power after the failed coup by the House of Duras in the
late 2360s. The Federation is openly hostile with the IKS but stops at outright conflict with them due to the Alliance with the Klingon
Empire. The Romulan Empire tolerates the IKS inasmuch as it keeps the balance of power in the Triangle in a constant state of flux.
The IKS and RFS’s attempts to seize control of the region have been persistent in the last ten years thanks to the Federations ever
increasing responsibilities in defending against Borg incursions and the Dominion. The vacuum created by the sporadic presence of
Starfleet vessels in the region has made the IKS/RFS alliance bold in their attempts to reign terror on the border worlds. In 2378, the
attacks on Federation colonies and installations reached a fever pitch and the call for action was becoming urgent. By early 2379,
Starfleet Intelligence had located two terrorist training/staging facilities on Brengar Tyvis, a planetoid in the RFS sphere of influence.
Led by the USS Canterbury and backed up by the Norway-class vessels Caesar and Pittsburgh, the Federation force moved on the
facility with the intention of closing it permanently. Upon dropping out of warp, the force was met by no less than five Warbirds
emerging from the target’s sensor shadow. The Canterbury ordered her two escorts to engage the enemy while she began the
bombardment of the target and sewed mines around her small spaceport. Meanwhile, the two cruisers were hard presses to counter the
enemy at two-to-one odds, but managed to make a fair showing early on. The Caesar almost immediately crippled the Warbird
T’sega with a withering barrage of phaser fire to her warp core. The Pittsburgh drew off three of the Warbirds and led them on a
merry chase around the planetoid, sometimes coming within five kilometers of its surface. By now the Canterbury has finished her
strike mission and has joined her escorts so they could extract themselves from the system. Unfortunately, the Pittsburgh was now in
poor shape and reported that she was on auxiliary power only and going down. The Canterbury arrived just in time to see the Caesar
take a direct hit to her engineering section and eject her warp core as the Warbird S’kkus come about for the kill. Fortunately, the
Federation flagship was able to destroy the S’kkus before she could complete her task and took the wounded vessel under tow. Upon
hearing nothing from the Pittsburgh, the Canterbury evacuated the scene of the attack and headed back for Federation space. Starfleet
Intelligence later learned that the Pittsburgh was forced to crash land on the planetoid’s surface during the attack and was lost with all
hands. After a lengthy evaluation, Starfleet Engineeering determined that the damage was too severe to the Caesar to warrant her
repair and scrapped the vessel.

   In 2364, Starfleet was at a crossroads in its starship design program. Doctrine of the day called for an emphasis on designing large
multimission starships in minimal numbers, and the fleet’s ability to respond in force had suffered. With the reemergence of the
Romulans as a threat after a 75 year absence and the Borg a new factor to contend with, Starfleet needed new vessels in large numbers
and time was of the essence. By mid-2365 several new designs had been chosen to lead the fleet in a construction program like none
other in Starfleet history. One of these came to be known as the Patriot-class heavy cruiser.

Classification: The Patriot-class is mostly found on patrol and escort-type assignments, and is classified as a cruiser.

Design: The Patriot-class design is clearly inspired by the Constitution-class starships of the late twenty-third century, and follows
the famous saucer/engineering hull/twin nacelle arrangement. In fact, for the basic warp field dynamics modeling and framework
design, the Patriot-started as just that. However, it is there that the similarities stop. With the basic structural and propulsion systems
scaled up nearly 35%, the Patriot ‘s size is comparable with the Excelsior-class and performs many of the duties of that venerable
design (minus the Excelsior’s outstanding exploratory capability). The Patriot is equipped with a saucer separation capability, but
reconnecting requires the facilities of a starbase or repair tender to reconnect. This provision is purely an emergency procedure and
has only been performed once in the life span of the design.

Engineering: The Patriot was designed from the outset around the powerful (and at the time, brand new) FUWR-1 (Federation Ultra
Warp type R/1) warp drive. This innovative power plant is capable of propelling the vessel at speeds of up to warp 9.85 for 12 hours,
the fastest starship of her time. The FIG-2 fit on the Mk I Patriots was sufficient for sublight operations, but a better match was found
in the FIG-4 upon release of the Mk II Patriots in 2378.

Tactical: The initial drive to get the Patriots into service necessitated the inclusion of two powerful but outdated weapons systems.
The FH-11 long range phaser from HighBeam Energies has been the weapon of choice for Starfleet for decades along with the FP-4
torpedo launch system. However, these gave way with the first Mk II Patriot in 2378 to newer tactical systems. The FH-16 delivers
the same power output as the old FH-11 but at a 25% increase in accuracy at close ranges. The FP-10 finally gives the Patriot a
defensive capability and flexibility missing from the old torpedo launch system. With an emphasis on offensive firepower and a
desire to keep the Patriot as light and maneuverable as possible, the vessels of the class lack aft mounted weaponry and have a
relatively rudimentary structural support system. Although it is sufficient for the load bearing requirements of the warp drive and
impulse system, the superstructure cannot stand much punishment. This more than anything has lead to the Patriot's abysmal attrition
rate in recent years. Upon the release of the Mk II Patriot, improvements in the structural integrity field generators and frame load
bearing members finally reduced the probability of structural collapse while retaining her superb handling characteristics.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The Patriot is considered to be a medium range cruiser and never strays far from the facilities of
a starbase. This allows the Patriot to focus on operational system requirements instead of recreational facilities. Although the vessels
do sport a number of the amenities found on all starships, the vessel’s fittings are largely utilitarian. Keeping in line with her military
operations mission profile, the Patriot’s lab and research facilities are rudimentary, and the vessel is rarely called upon for exploration
duty. However, her sensor suite is state-of-the-art and the class and boasts an impressive communications array. Despite advances in
bio-neural and hybrid computer cores, the standard triple redundant isolinear computer system has been fit on all vessels of this class.

Development and Construction History: The Patriot-class was a joint design by Starfleet Engineering and Starfleet Tactical of San
Francisco as a part of the SSDP Project (Small Starship Development Program) with advanced computer modeling and testing taking
place at Utopia Planitia. The vessel’s of the class are produced at nearly every major shipyard in the Federation and are constructed at



                                                                   97

a rate of five per year. Of the 68 Patriots constructed, 48 remain in active service with one, the class ship USS Patriot serving with
Starfleet Training command. Construction of the Patriot has been funded through the end of fiscal year 2385 with the production run
contract expecting to be renewed for another 10 years. The Patriot-class starships are known in many circles as the "Dead Ships"
class. Many of her number are named after vessels lost in the defense of the Federation. Six are named after starships lost at the
Battle of Wolf 359, with others attributed to the Cardassian, Raven and Tholian conflicts.

On stardate 4/7403.13, Starbase 74 declared the USS Regulus "overdue, presumed lost" after a month long search failed to find traces
of the vessel. The Regulus was assigned to patrol near the Orion border where recent hostilities had seen the loss of the Federation
supply vessel SS Stonewall Jackson. The Regulus reported no activity in the area on 4/7402.02 and was continuing her patrol. After
failing to report in two days later, the starships Niagara and Polaris were sent to find for the Regulus, but the efforts were called off
after a month of searching. Oddly, a hull section identified as a part of the Regulus' tractor beam assembly was found on the other side
of the Federation in deep space eight months later. No explanation was ever forthcoming why a part of the Regulus was found in a
sector of the galaxy to which the starship had never visited.

As a part of Solar Wind 95 in 2374, the starships Cartwright and Crusader were practicing field refueling and replenishment drills
alongside the tanker SS Kalidas when something went horribly wrong. The Cartwright was tractoring aboard a pallet of replacement
parts to simulate a cargo transporter failure when the incident occurred. The tractor beam suddenly suffered a power sag after a failure
of an impulse reaction container. The beam lost its hold on the pallet, allowing it to slam into the thin hull of the Kalidas. The
collision ruptured the vessel’s deuterium stores, which in turn vented into the cargo area which was at the time readying to transfer
photon torpedoes to the Crusader. The resulting explosion ripped the Kalidas in half, and the shockwave violently tore into the
unshielded Cartwright and Crusader. Both vessels were immediately forced to eject their warp cores, leaving each with only minimal
power. Internal fires threatened to rupture the Cartwright's own fuel tanks, so Captain Morgenstern ordered the star drive abandoned
and an explosive bolts separation of the saucer was implemented. Both vessels were later met by the starships Valdemar and
Cromwell, with the hospital ship Voris providing relief for the wounded aboard the two stricken vessels. Due to her deteriorated
condition, the Cartwright was later scuttled on the spot by a phaser volley from the Valdemar. The Crusader was towed back to
Starbase 20 and scraped the next month after she was declared a total loss. Among the lost were the entire crew of the Kalidas, 22
aboard the Crusader and 46 from the Cartwright. The Cartwright's losses included the executive officer, ships doctor, chief engineer
and six civilians. The ships XO, Lieutenant Commander Donald O'Hare, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Valor after he
sacrificed his life to manually initiate the explosive bolts separation of the Cartwright's saucer after the main computer failed.

On stardate 4/7703.17, Task Force L, consisting of the Galaxy-class starship Saratoga, Southampton, Gandhi, and MacArthur, was
attacked by IKS forces near the Bolivar system. The enemy, which outnumbered the Federation forces 6-4, quickly outmaneuvered
and overwhelmed the Starfleet vessels. During the battle the Saratoga took several direct hits to engineering, leaving the flagship
dead in space. The remaining Federation vessels retreated at that time under orders by Captain Young on the Saratoga. The Saratoga
was soon boarded and taken under tow to IKS space. Three days later, under a cloak of secrecy, a Federation force of thirty vessels
left Starbase 12 for IKS space. The force is one of the largest during the Raven war, consisting of the starships Valiant, Majestic,
Algeo, Bonnaventure, Pegasus, Kitty Hawk, Melbourne, Canberra, New Jersey, and many others. Their primary task is to strike the
IKS maintenance/construction depot at K'tog IV. If possible, they are to retake or destroy the captured starship USS Saratoga which
was rumored to be under repairs at K'tog IV. What happened later that week can only be called the Starfleet’s most humiliating defeat
since the Dominion war. Although the battle started well, the attack was a tactical failure, and would deeply curtail Starfleet's ability
to respond to enemy action in the Triangle region for months. It also gave the IKS a propaganda victory of enormous proportions by
being able to claim the defeat of a tactically superior foe. The Federation force was able to only damage the IKS' repair and supply
depot, and totally failed to retake the captured starship Saratoga. The final cost to the Federation is nearly 3700 dead, the total loss of
ten starships, among them the Patriot-class USS Cannae and Yamashiro. The Xavante and Hellfire suffer varying degrees of damage.
The Klingon forces suffered the loss of seven warships and the damaging of two others. The supply depot lost two of its six supply
docks, several freighters, a repair facility, and several antiquated destroyers. It would be another six months until the Saratoga is
retaken from the Klingons by Captain Carmichael of the starship Renown. The badly ravaged Galaxy-class starship would spend the
better part of three months being refurbished before she is returned to service.

   Early on in the Ambassador-class design phase, it became clear to mission planners that while their new design would revolutionize
starship deployments, the unprecedented scope of the vehicles and their enormous cost would severely limit construction. Until an
acceptable number of units could be fielded, a smaller class was needed to fill the gaps left by the Ambassador’s limited availability.
Drawing on the new technologies coming out of that project, the Renaissance-class was intended to fill the temporary gap left by their
larger multimission counterparts.

Classification: Although the Renaissance-class performs a number of duties for Starfleet, she is classified as a cruiser.

Design: While the Renaissance shares many of the external features and attributes of the Ambassador, the design is a 75% scale
reproduction of the original specs. With the changing warp field dynamics and an increased emphasis on long range patrol and
exploration duties, the nacelles were canted down 90° to allow the bussard collectors unrestricted access to interstellar gases to
increase fuel stores.

Engineering: Although early design plans called for mounting the FIWA series warp drive in the initial production batch of
Renaissances, the engines proved to be too heavy for the hull frame and a substitute had to be found. The FIWC-1 was developed as a
stand in type for the heavier drive units and was deployed on the first 23 units. However, the drive soon began experiencing
overheating problems and microcrystalline fracturing in the dilithium chamber lining and injector ports. Starting in 2334, production



                                                                 100

was switched over to the more powerful and reliable FUWD-1 drive assembly. Existing vessels were pulled in for refit to the new
drive specs as the problems cropped up, and all remaining ships were upgraded to the new standard by 2350. The tried and true FIG-1
impulse drive provides ample maneuvering power at sublight velocities with plenty of auxiliary power in reserve.

Tactical: The FH-10 phaser system used aboard the Renaissance is similar to the type deployed aboard the Ambassador, but with one
exception. Instead of utilizing two power streams in the standard firing volley, an additional third stream provides a 33% increase in
power throughput. If a rapid-fire mode is desired, the three beams can split off into a group of two with a follow-up up single beam
punch. This versatility has made the Renaissance a favorite for task force operations. The FP-4 torpedo launchers are standard for
their day but are quickly becoming obsolete. Upgrades are planned in the next refit cycle starting in 2385. With the engine refits
taking place starting in 2334 Starfleet took the opportunity to mount the new pentatransducing shield generators coming out of the
Discovery-class pathfinder project.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The Renaissance-class starships are fairly comfortable by any standard, and this is by no
accident. With a design emphasis on exploration, the crew can expect to be away from port for months or even years at a time. The
amenities are a stopgap against crew fatigue on these long deployments. The computer system aboard the Renaissance is the same
type used aboard the Ambassador, and is quite adequate for the vessel’s needs.

Development and Construction History: Of the 30 Renaissance-class starships built, 8 remain in active service. One, the
USS Longstreet, was lost to the Borg at the Battle of Wolf 359. Heavy losses in the Dominion and Raven conflicts have severely
reduced the numbers of available Renaissance-class vessels, mostly due to their almost nonstop use during those engagements. A
modernization program is planned to commence in 2384 to extend the lives of these veteran starships into the next century. The
Renaissance-class was built at numerous facilities throughout the Federation with an emphasis on the San Francisco and Antares Fleet
Yards.

   After a thirty-eight year production run, the New Orleans-class starships were nearing the end of their viability as new constructs.
Technological innovations had made the venerable craft if not obsolete, then at least inefficient to produce. Instead of scraping the
class entirely, a plan was put forth to improve upon the old design. Unfortunately, the result was the lackluster Saint Louis-class.

Classification: Although she was originally designed as a frigate, her low maneuverability and high-end tactical systems classify the
Saint Louis as a cruiser.

Design: With only moderate modifications to the outer hull design and the internal rearrangement of the secondary hull, the Saint
Louis closely follows the design parameters set down by the New Orleans-class.

Engineering: The Saint Louis utilizes a modified version of the warp drive system mounted aboard the Galaxy-class with twin FIG-1
impulse drives providing maneuvering power at sublight speeds. For a vessel plagued with design bugs, the propulsion systems
aboard the Saint Louis have been fairly reliable with only minor revisions since her commissioning in 2377. Although the mounting
of the heavy FUWA-2 warp drive allows high-speed emergency sprints up to warp 9.75, they slow the vessel considerably at impulse
speeds. After a design review in 2376, the tradeoff was deemed disappointing but acceptable. In 2378, a general recall of the class
was issued to replace faulty EPS flow regulators on all five commissioned vessels. The problem was eventually traced back to a
mistake in the class’ early design stages and faulty part specifications being sent to the fabrication facility on Luna.

Tactical: While it can be said that the FH-15 phaser array and FP-10 torpedo launchers are far superior to the older systems aboard
the New Orleans, their added weight further slows the Saint Louis, and the computer targeting software was initially prone to crashes.
Her FSR-3 shield system is a further source of disappointment, as it was lifted virtually as-is from the old New Orleans-class. While
reliable and adequate for most vessel’s needs, the design is dated and clearly in need of replacement.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The Saint Louis is a long range tactical operations and support vessel whose long periods
between port visits necessitates the addition of better than average crew amenities and living quarters. Her 125 member Marine
contingent is only rarely fully deployed aboard ship leaving the Saint Louis’ roomy for their size. The computer system aboard the
Saint Louis is an all bioneural setup with the standard redundant isolinear backup. In 2377, the USS John Adams had to spend a
memorable three months in spacedock having an entire computer core replaced only weeks after commissioning. The problem was
eventually traced to a power surge that irradiated her bioneural gel packs and burnt out the isolinear chip backups, the first such failure
of that type since the new computer system was introduced eight years before.

Development and Construction History: After a production run of only five vessels, the entire project was canceled and the
partially completed hulls of two ships were sold for scrap. The abysmal quality of the vessel’s design eventually led to a Federation
Council inquiry into the Starfleet Engineering Bureau's design authorization division. Their findings resulted in the resignation of the
division head and ten subordinates with fines being imposed on three subcontractors providing various system integration services on
the design project. By mid-2379, the construction flaws in the existing Saint Louis-class starships had been resolved, and all five are
serving Starfleet in a variety of duties. However, they remain unpopular assignments for their officers and crews. Of the five Saint
Louis-class cruisers constructed, all of them are currently in service. The vessels were built at the Luna and Sol III shipyards, and no
plans exist to build more.

   The Surak-class cruiser has served with Starfleet for the last six decades as a capable if nondescript vessel that excelled at nothing
but is good at everything. Fit as a multimission exploration cruiser years before that designation even existed, the Surak has done
more to chart the far flung backwaters of the Federation than some starships twice her size and capabilities. Although they were never
produced in abundance, they remain one of the most beloved designs to come out of the 40 Eridani spacedocks in the last century.

Classification: The Surak is designated as a cruiser.

Design: At first glance, one is immediately struck by the Surak’s long sleek lines that were clearly inspired by the Excelsior-class of
thirty years before. The saucer section is a remarkably roomy design with almost all of the lab and engineering gear stowed in the
stardrive.

Engineering: The Surak’s FIWA-1 warp drive is the same type utilized by the Excelsior-class and is capable of a top speed of warp
9.1 for twelve hours with a cruising speed of warp six. While this is par for her time, her limited speed keeps her from most defensive
duties today. Her small FIF-2 impulse drives have always been a matter of concern and provide only limited maneuverability at
sublight speeds. However, the Surak’s true calling has always been as vessels of exploration, and a series of five and eight year
charting missions in the late 2330s and 2340s more than proved the reliability of these powerplants. Extensive refits after these
missions kept the Surak’s in step with modern technology and they remain some of the most well equipped older model vessels in
service.

Tactical: The tactical system aboard the Surak are by no means meant for offensive operations. Although her combat capability is
more than sufficient for most needs, the Surak will avoid a fight when possible. However, when she is pushed the vessel can draw
upon a phaser system that provides excellent all around coverage and a torpedo launch capability equal to the Excelsior-class’. In the
early 2360s, all Surak’s received upgrades to the new FSS-2a shield standards to provide more robust protection from threat forces
and natural phenomena.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: Like any long range explorer, the Surak is equipped with the most modern crew amenities
available to ease the long periods between shore leave. For scientists and researchers, assignment to a Surak-class vessel is a much
sought after assignment and is considered a fast track to promotion. The computer systems aboard ship are an improved version of the
type developed for the Excelsior-class with extra storage and processing capabilities.

Development and Construction History: Of the eleven Surak-class vessels constructed, five remain in active service with one, the
USS McKinly lost to the Borg at the Battle of Wolf 359. Construction took place entirely at the Shar Ta’kel Central Docks above
Vulcan between 2315 and 2339.

Atheron-class Exploration Cruiser
Number    Name                         Builder                                    Laid Down     Launched Commissioned Status
NCC-78544 Atheron                      Utopia Planitia Fleet Yards, Mars          4/7403        4/7812   4/8002       Active




   In 2379, Starfleet was ending the production run of the Mosby-class starship, a capable if not undergunned exploration vessel.
While these starship had proven themselves time and again in pushing back the borders of Federation space, the class's combat record
was less than spectacular. While the potential of the original hull form and support systems held promise, they had never been fully
exploited. Starfleet Engineering was determined to make at least one of the Mosby's the cruiser it should have been. On stardate
4/7412.07, hull number PCU-78544 was taken from its parking orbit above Mars' Utopia Planitia and hauled to an R&D facility.
Once there, the Mosby Experimental Designs Team began the process of reengineering the vessel.

Classification: Like the Mosby, the Atheron is classified as an Exploration Cruiser with a secondary emphasis on tactical support
missions. However, her recent mission profiles have shown that the Atheron is suited to duties more resembling a battlecruiser or
dreadnought, and she may be refit to these specifications in the near future.

Design: The Atheron is a stock Mosby-class hull with a third nacelle mounted on the dorsal spine. The saucer section’s shuttle
facilities were modified to accommodate the new engine arrangement by building a new bay in the fore section of the saucer section
and retrofitting the aft bay as an emergency escape pod facility and converting the rest of the space to cargo storage. Lastly the
engineers removed the vessel’s saucer separation ability to add rigidity to the hull. The end result is a vessel whose internal
arrangement is almost completely dissimilar to the Mosby’s.

Engineering: The redesign of the Atheron’s engine arrangement allowed the inclusion of the new FUWR-1 warp drive, a system that
is far more efficient than the FUWA-1 that the Mosby class was originally fit with. Although the third nacelle does not allow the
vessel to go any faster than a conventional starship, she can maintain warp 9.6 for 24 hours, twice as long as what the Mosby is
capable of. Her saucer mounted twin FIG-2 impulse drives add additional power reserves and provide impressive handling at sublight
speeds.

Tactical: Aside from the new engine arrangement, the engineers in charge of the Atheron’s redesign were primarily concerned with
updating the vessel’s tactical systems. The FH-11 array was removed and upgraded to the longer ranged FH-16 while the FP-4
torpedo tubes were replaced with the FP-10 standard. However, the real change came from the saucer mounted FH-18 forward firing
phaser cannon. This innovation increased the Atheron’s phaser capacity by 83% and provided her with a weapon capable of tearing
any unshielded vessel in half. In fact, the recoil created from the firing of the cannon is so powerful that the emitter’s targeting
software is slaved to the vessel’s thruster segments to provide backpressure against the blast.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: With the addition of all of the new support equipment and engineering spaces, the crew
compliment increased while the habitable volume decreased, giving the vessel a cramped, utilitarian atmosphere. Although the vessel
is categorized as an explorer, the fuel load and crew support systems constrain the Atheron to border duties or inter-Federation support
missions. Despite this, the Atheron is a popular vessel with her crews and is a choice assignment. The Atheron’s computer system is
a hybrid bioneural/isolinear makeup and far outperforms the vessel’s needs.

Development and Construction History: The Atheron was constructed at the Utopia Planitia Fleet Yards and is a one of a kind
vessel. No further units of this class are planned. Bulk refits of existing Mosby-class vessels to Atheron specifications were
considered briefly in 2382 and discarded as being too costly.

   The Challenger and Iowa-class projects find their roots in the waning days of the Galaxy-class design phase. Starfleet realized that
the Galaxy would be a phenomenal success, but its cost limited the fleet to six, or at most twelve hulls. To counter this, Starfleet
Engineering drew on the new technologies coming out of the Galaxy design and produced the Challenger, and later derived from it the
Iowa. Designed as a long range exploration cruiser, the Challenger has only been a moderate success. Although it packs the same
shields, weapons, and engine systems of the Galaxy, the Challenger’s cost is much less than her bigger brothers. The Challenger lacks
much of the offensive punch that the Galaxy enjoys, but her science and sensor facilities are identical to the larger starship.

Classification: The Challenger is classified as a mutlimission exploration cruiser.

Design: The Challenger is derived from the successful Alaska class hullform with an enlarged saucer section and reworked secondary
hull. She also sports an enlarged hangar bay and improved cruising range thanks to expanded fuel storage facilities.

Engineering: Challenger-class starships are equipped with an improved version of the revolutionary FUWA-2 (Federation Improved
Warp type A/2) warp drive developed and first fielded by the Galaxy-class. The drive system is capable of propelling the vessel at
speeds up to warp 9.6 with a cruising speed of warp 6. Impulse power is provided by the FIH-1 system made famous on the Apollo-
class starships in the years before. Due to her lighter tactical systems and lessened auxiliary power needs, the Challenger does not
suffer from the poor sublight maneuverability problems that have plagued the Iowa-class, and the FIH-1 drive has proven adequate.

Tactical: The Challenger has been criticized for years for her light phaser array. While coverage from the FH-15 collimator is not a
concern, her rate of fire is a problem. Fortunately, the torpedo system is identical to the one employed by the Nebula-class, and
provides a considerable backup punch.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The Challenger-class was designed in a time when support for a civilian population aboard ship
was being highly emphasized for new constructs. This and her long range exploration ability means that the Challengers are fit with
the most advanced recreational facilities available in Starfleet. This also necessitated the addition of a shuttle bay and lifeboat outfit
capable of evacuating the ship’s compliment twice over. The computer if of the same type developed for the Galaxy-class, and is
more then ample for the vessel’s needs.

Development and Construction History: The Challenger-class is named for the Terran Columbia-class space shuttle lost in 1986 to
a catastrophic engine failure. Of the 18 Challengers built, 13 remain in service. One, the Buran, was lost to the Borg at the Battle of
Wolf 359. Construction was concluded in 2379 at the San Francisco Fleet Yards with the commissioning of the USS Formidable.
With the cessation of hostilities with the Dominion in 2376, the last two planned vessels of the class were canceled and one
incomplete hull was scrapped at 7% completion.

Historical Notes:
                Challenger     Destroyed by a catastrophic shipboard fire while patroling near Tholian space on stardate 4/7311.
                Copernicus     Reported lost, resumed destroyed while in transit to Vulcan on stardate 4/8107.
                Buran          One of thirty-nine vessels destroyed by the Borg at the Battle of Wolf 359 on stardate 4/6701.
                Kearsarge      Destroyed by forces of the Romulan Free States in the Triangle region on stardate 4/7811.
                Furious        Destroyed by the Borg at the Battle of Typhon on stardate 4/7305.
                Darius         Scrapped after taking extensive structural damage while attempting to rescue the crew of a downed
                               Vulcan science ship on Galorndon Core on stardate 4/7610.

The threat of fire is a constant aboard a vessel as complex as a starship and has been the result of numerous tragedies in the years since
Starfleet’s founding. The problem is compounded by the volatility of numerous shipboard systems and the limited amount of
breathable oxygen carried by even the largest vessels. On stardate 4/7311.24, the USS Challenger was patrolling near the Tholian
border when something went catastrophically wrong. Details are sketchy due to the nature of the explosion, but ship records showed
that the primary plasma conduit in the secondary hull suffered a massive breech while engineers were realigning the flow rate after a
high warp sprint destabilized several primary system. The explosion not only crippled the power distribution net but ruptured the
Challenger’s deuterium stores which touched off fires throughout the secondary hull and flooded the vessel with volatile fuel. Captain
Rajara ordered the crew to fall back to the still intact saucer section so the vessel could be separated from the burning engineeering
section. Unfortunately, the explosions that were wracking the secondary hull had damaged the docking clamps that held the vessel
together making saucer separation impossible. With fires continuing to spread out of control and the anti-matter pod ejection system
off line, the Captain ordered the Challenger to be abandoned in place. Once the Challenger was evacuated, the fires continued to
spread until the ship was consumed and the anti-matter pods finally tore the ship apart. The crew was rescued two days later when the
USS Sakharov arrived on station to pick up survivors. Of the 983 people aboard the Challenger, 59 were lost in the fire with another
122 suffering various injuries. Among those killed was the vessel’s chief engineer and senior operations officer.

On stardate 4/7610, the starship Darius was charting cosmic string fragments near the Romulan Neutral Zone when she received
a distress signal from the independent science vessel SS T'Par. The Vulcan registered ship had been disabled in a meteor shower and
was forced to crash land on Galorndon Core with 217 people aboard. The Darius rushed to the scene, and was met with distressing
news. A devastating plasma storm was heading for the T'Par's crash site, and would kill all aboard unless an evacuation was effected.
Captain S'vrel of the Darius ordered his vessel far into the planet’s upper atmosphere so the transporters would be able to break
through the electromagnetic interference. He kept the vessel there for three orbits until all of the T'Par's crew was beamed aboard,
then ordered the Darius out of the planet's atmosphere. During the climb out, the port nacelle's pylon buckled, tearing it from the hull
and striping the ship's skin from part of the aft sections. Captain S'vrel then ordered the starboard nacelle ejected to even the
aerodynamic loads, allowing the Darius crawl into orbit. During her time in the planet’s atmosphere, the unshielded Darius suffered
extensive metallurgical damage, the failure of nearly 60% of her shipboard systems, and the total loss of the warp drive. After the
survivors were transferred to the starships Pegasus and Eisenhower, the Darius was scuttled in orbit by a single torpedo.

   The loss of 39 starships to the Borg at the Battle of Wolf 359 was a shocking blow not only to Starfleet but to the research and
exploration efforts of the Federation. Fewer field worthy starships meant less time spent in the backwaters of unexplored space
pushing back the boundaries of Federation science. Shortly after the apocalyptic battle, Starfleet was scrambling to meet the needs of
border commanders by reactivating as many viable mothballed starships as possible in the shortest time manageable. Most of these
vessels went to the front with no more than a minor refurbishing, some updated hardware and little else. To make up for the losses the
exploratory fleet had suffered, Starfleet Engineering decided to do something special. Four of the most viable Constitution-class
starship hulls were pulled from their parking orbits over Memory Beta and taken to a refit yard at the Makin County Fleet Yards.
Once there, the hulls were stripped down to their framework and rebuilt one piece at a time. At the same time, the most modern
sensor suite, computer core and support systems available were integrated into their hulls making them some of the most sophisticated
front line starships available. For a vessel commissioned nearly 100 years before, the refits were a new lease on life for the venerable
Constitution-class and represented a new chance to serve with the fleet for an additional fifty years, a full 125 years beyond their
originally projected design life.

Classification: The Constitutions refits were redesignated as Exploration Cruisers to denote their new status in the fleet.

Design: The Constitution class has defined the look of starships since her introduction in 2245. The classic saucer section, secondary
hull and twin nacelle arrangement is the standard for the fleet and will remain so for the foreseeable future.

Engineering: The warp drive fit aboard the refit vessels is the new and compact FUWE-1 by Leeding Engines Inc. Capable of
driving the vessel at speeds up to warp 9.5 for twelve hours with a cruising speed of warp 6.2, the new drive assembly has completely
revitalized the class as a whole. The FIG-2 impulse drive is a holdover from the Constitution’s glory days, and remains to be more
than sufficient for the vessel’s needs.

Tactical: The FH-11 phaser array made their debut with the Constitution-class in 2271 and remains in service to this day. Although
some of the bulkier components have been miniaturized in the decades since their introduction, they remain virtually unchanged
aboard the four refit Constitutions. However, the twin FP-4 torpedo launchers at the base of the connecting ”neck” structure have
been removed and replaced with a single integrated FP-10 launcher, a marked improvement over the old system. For shielding, the
ultra-light but very powerful FSQ-1 was mounted and is more than enough considering the Constitution-class’ peaceful mission scope.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The crew load aboard the Constitution has been lessened greatly thanks to the automation of
several of her primary systems. What crew there is enjoys comfortable quarters and recreational facilities to blunt the trauma of being
away from port for months or even years at a time for research missions. Ironically, the Constitution refits were some of the first
vessels equipped with the bio-neural computer system for primary system processing and a standard isolinear core as a backup.
Although the Intrepid-class was the first vessel designed with this innovation, the Constitution refits were the first to field it.

Development and Construction History: Of the four vessels pulled from mothballs for refit in early 2367, three remain in active
service. No further reactivations are planned for the future.

   In the 2350s and 60s, Starfleet began to experiment with allowing officers to bring their families aboard ship for extended
assignments. They were confident that the stability provided by a strong family presence would improve productivity and help retain
valuable crewmen who wished to balance their career goals with the desire to be near loved ones. Unfortunately, service in space is
far from safe, and many vessels were lost along with their civilian passengers despite the best efforts to keep them as out of harm's
way as possible. For many years after the policy of adding civilian accommodations aboard ship was either outright abandoned or
designed out of new starship construction. Many felt that the benefits of having family aboard a starship were outweighed by the
inherent risks.
   Fortunately by the early 2380s, attitudes had changed along with the overall stability of the Alpha Quadrant, and a second attempt
was made to incorporate families into the long-range explorers of the fleet. While many classes of starships would continue to enter
service without civilian quarters, the Galatea-class exploration cruiser would not be one of them.

Classification: Due to her primary role of explorer, long range and capability for offensive operations, the Galatea is designated as
an exploration cruiser.

Design: The Galatea is more of an evolution of the Sovereign-class design than an upgrade and takes the aesthetics and engineering
principals of that class to the next level. Her warp nacelles are a revolutionary ellipsoid shape that follows the design of the other
major hull segments. Her gracefully curving engine pylons and connecting dorsal maintain the traditional look of Starfleet’s more
prominent ships of exploration while remaining functional and true to Starfleet Engineering standards.

Engineering: The Galatea’s massive FIUWR-1warp drive provides an almost obscene amount of primary power to the vessel’s
primary systems. Clearly the design has been over engineered for her size, but this was done on purpose to provide her civilian
population with the best measure of safety possible. Her twin FIG-3 impulse drives provide an acceptable top sublight speed but
provide only passable maneuverability. However, in a crisis, the Galatea is to rely on her superior warp threshold acceleration curve
top emergency speed of warp 9.85 to avoid any overwhelming situations.

Tactical: The FH-116 phaser system installed aboard the Galatea was obviously chosen to give the ship’s commander the option of
engaging an enemy from as great a range as possible and therefore affording his passengers an extra measure of safety. Eleven full
banks of these weapons cover every conceivable approach angel and give the sluggish vessel greater flexibility for engagements at
speeds below warp 1. Her FP-10 torpedo system was lifted from the Akira-class with few modifications, and her saucer mounted FQ-
1 torpedo launcher is a scaled down version of the type developed for the Frontier and Majestic-class starships. Her FSW-2 shield
generators are of a type quickly becoming the standard for new vessel deployment and provide a comfortable level of protection.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: As a vessel of exploration, it is expected that the Galatea will spend years at a time far from
Federation support facilities, and the ships of the class are as well equipped as any in the fleet. Early Galaxy-class vessels set the
standard for civilian accommodations, and 25 years later are being improved upon for use aboard the fleet’s newest explorer. The
goal of 100% EMH coverage throughout the ship has finally been achieved with the Galatea, the first in the fleet. Her bioneural
computer network is a rework of the type developed for the Intrepid-class and is currently the most state of the art system in the fleet.

Development and Construction History: Baring any unforeseen circumstances, the first Galatea-class exploration cruiser is
expected to enter fleet service in early 2386. Six vessels of the class are planned, though this may be expanded upon at the discretion
of Starfleet Engineering. Construction will proceed at a rate of one unit per year for the next six years.

   Starfleet has long been charged with a broad spectrum of responsibilities to the citizens of the Federation. As the volume of
explored space continued to grow, and with it the Federation itself, so do Starfleet’s duties.
   These duties range from relatively mundane domestic and civil missions, to cultural contact and diplomacy, to defense, and to the
primary mission of exploration and research. Many of these responsibilities are best carried out with relatively small, specialized
ships. Yet there continues to be an ongoing need for a small number of larger, multimission vehicles that are capable of implementing
the complete range of Starfleet’s objectives. This need has in fact grown as the volume of relatively unexplored space within
Federation influence continues to expand.
   The Galaxy-class starship represents Starfleet’s most sophisticated achievement in multimission ship systems design.
   Pursuant to Starfleet Exploration directive 902.3, the following objectives were established for the Galaxy-class Starship
Development Project:
                  -Provide a mobile platform for a wide range of ongoing scientific and cultural research projects.
                  -Replace aging Ambassador and Oberth-class starships as primary instruments of Starfleet’s exploration programs.
                  -Provide autonomous capability for full execution of Federation policy options in outlying regions.
                  -Incorporate recent advancements in warp powerplant technology and science instrumentation.
                  -Provide the ability to defend the interests of the Federation with the most up-to-date tactical systems available.

Classification: The Galaxy-class is categorized as an explorer.




                                                                  117

Design: The Galaxy-class hullform follows a traditional arrangement found to be highly efficient for high warp transitional
acceleration and energy conservation. The general layout is the familiar saucer section connected to a secondary hull with a
connecting dorsal section. Twin nacelles trail out from the engineering section in an arrangement that allows the Bussard collectors
the most efficient access to interstellar gas collection and lets the warp field layers combine effectively and propel the vessel at high
speeds. A primary requirement of the Galaxy’s design was the ability to separate the saucer section and act as two separate
autonomous vessels in a crisis situation. For a vessel designed to support civilians, this was an utmost concern.

Engineering: The Galaxy was the first vessel to incorporate the innovative FUWA-1 (Federation Warp type A/1) warp drive. This
revolutionary system can propel the vessel at a normal cruising speed of warp 6 until fuel exhaustion, a maximum cruising speed of
warp 9.2, and a maximum top speed of warp 9.6 for twelve hours. For sublight propulsion the vessel relies on three sets of impulse
engines, one in the stardrive and two in the saucer section. While the supplementary power and propulsive forces of the impulse deck
is adequate, the Galaxy-class as been criticized for being sluggish at subluminal velocities.

Tactical: The main phaser array aboard the Galaxy-class is the powerful FH-15 by HiBeam Energies. Arranged in the now familiar
collimated strip layout, the phasers can cover the vessel from any attack angle. The Galaxy-class also sports three photon torpedo
launchers in a fore/aft arrangement with one of the launchers mounted in the saucer section for use during separated flight maneuvers
only. Each tube can fire as many as ten torpedoes at a time with a typical reload sequence taking approximately 60-90 seconds. The
Galaxy-class also has the ability to handle the new FQ-1 quantum torpedoes for use against threat forces.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The Galaxy-class sports the most up to date lab and sensor facilities the fleet has to offer, and is
fully equipped to carry out any number of diplomatic functions. The inclusion of civilians in the ship’s design has allowed the Galaxy
to sport the most luxurious crew appointments in the fleet. A combination of aboard ship schools, athletic facilities and holodecks
make the Galaxy a comfortable assignment indeed. For crew and passenger safety, the vessel incorporates lifeboat and shuttle
facilities to evacuate the ship’s standard compliment three times over. The computer systems aboard the Galaxy-class starships are a
standard ioslinear circuitry makeup in a traditional triple redundant configuration. Later vessels of the class incorporate a hybrid bio-
neural/isolinear design for high speed processing. From the construction of the Victory and forward, vessels of the class have been
completed with an all bio-neural computer system.

Development and Construction History:
         Flight 1 Galaxy-class starships
         Galaxy-Gallant First six vessels completed to initial design specs. Venture and Gallant retrofited with an external fix
         to the “warp speed pollution barrier." Galaxy is later fit with an internal solution during refit in 2372. Gallant refit to her
         own class specifications after a near total rebuild and redesign in 2377.

           Flight 2 Galaxy-class starships
           Yorktown-Sarek Second group of spaceframes pulled from storage and completed to counter the Borg threat. This group
           eliminated the cetatian labs to increase fuel storage and crew facilities. Incorporates a reengineered impulse suite for better
           handling at subluminal velocities and a slightly improved deflector shield system. Magellan and Sarek launched with only
           40% of their internal spaces fit for service in the Dominion War. Later fit out in 2378. Saucer section from the
           downstream vessel Constellation used to replace the unit lost during the Saratoga's flight trials. All downstream vessels
           affected. Equiped with an external fix to the "warp speed pollution barrier." All surviving Flight 1 vessels were eventually
           refit to the new type.

           Flight 3 Galaxy-class starships
           Algeo-current Incorporates design changes and a new internal layout unique to the Galaxy-class. Slightly less spacious
           and with a larger crew, the vessel incorporates 20 years of design revisions for the class as well as a number of
           technological innovations developed in recent years. These include an integrated bio-neural net, EMH access to nearly
           70% of the vessel’s habital internal volume, an internal fix for the "warp speed pollution barrier," and the hard mounting of
           the saucer and star drive sections. First incarnation of the class not fit out to carry civilians or operate in Separated Flight
           Mode. The elimination of the saucer reconnect systems and redundant SFM equipment allows for a larger crew
           compliment, increased fuel capacity and longer cruising range. Algeo launched with only 45% of her internal spaces fit for
           service in the Dominion War. Later completed in 2379. Constellation and all further downstream vessels delayed for ten
           months to replace the lost saucer section of the Saratoga. Incorporates most of the damage control and tactical innovations
           of the Mythe-class as well as new lab facilities and sensor suites. Algeo used as a technological testbed for the innovative
           Emergency Holographic Anti-incursion program, designed to counter boarding attempts and for rapid internal security
           response. Victory briefly considered for construction as the third Mythe-class battlecruiser and building continued on these
           lines for several months. The plan was dropped upon the cessation of hostilities with the Dominion and she was completed
           to spec within her original class design. However, she still incorporates several tactical and structural features unique to
           the Mythe-class.

   The Galaxy-class starship represents Starfleet's most sophisticated achievement in multimission ship systems design. However, no
design goes without eventual change, and the Gallant is a prime example of the Galaxy's flexibility. Originally launched as a Mk II
Galaxy in 2367, the Gallant served faithfully for ten years, mostly in the exploration service, before events placed her back in the arms
of Starfleet Engineering.
   On stardate 4/7604.08, the Gallant was jumped by two Romulan D'deridex-class Warbirds while patrolling near Starbase 20, a
region well within Federation borders. During the fight, the Gallant was badly crippled to the extent that she is forced to eject her
warp core. With the help of another starship the enemy is driven from the field, but the Gallant suffered grievous damage to her
structural system, warp drive and tactical array. After she was towed back to SB 20 for repairs, Starfleet Engineering found
themselves faced with four options. Repair the starship, refit her as a Mythe-class battlecruiser, scrap her, or radically redesign her. In
the end, Starfleet Command refused the idea of scraping a Galaxy-class starship, and it was agreed that the three remaining options
would take approximately the same amount of time. So, the decision is made to mold the Gallant into something unique.

Classification: The Gallant is classified as a long-range tactical explorer.

Design: The Gallant-class hullform follows a traditional arrangement found to be highly efficient for high warp transitional
acceleration and energy conservation. The general layout is the familiar saucer section connected to a secondary hull with a
connecting dorsal section. Twin nacelles trail out from the engineering section in an arrangement that allows the bussard collectors
the most efficient access to interstellar gas collection, lets the warp field layers combine effectively and propel the vessel at high
speeds. The third nacelle on the dorsal spine contains specialized Dynamic Warp Field Overlay Projectors (DWFOP) to allow the
vessel to operate on just two or even one nacelle in an emergency situation.

Engineering: During the refit, the FUWA-1 warp drive was removed from the Gallant and replaced with the lighter and more
efficient FUWR-2. Even with the increased weight of the third nacelle and its associated equipment, the FUWR-2 overcomes the
traditional difficulties associated with tri-nacelle starships. With those problems eliminated, the advantages of three nacelles become
clear as it allows the Gallant to maintain high warp speeds for longer periods of time. Whereas a Mk II Galaxy-class starship can
maintain warp 9.6 for twelve hours, the Gallant can maintain that speed for three times as long. By dividing the propulsive forces
among the three nacelles, the warp core tolerances are much greater, allowing for longer high-speed sprints. The FIG-4 impulse
drives mounted in the saucer section were replaced with FIH-1s and reinforced to accommodate the new off axis thrust vectors.

Tactical: The damage taken in battle against the Romulans necessitated the almost total removal of the Gallant’s phaser mounts and
the rebuilding of the fore/aft torpedo launchers. Instead of reintegrating the standard FH-15 phaser array, the heavier FH-18 was
chosen to take advantage of the power surplus provided by the enhanced warp drive. The Gallant also sports the standard FP-10
torpedo launchers in a fore/aft arrangement capable of firing as many as ten torpedoes at a time with a typical reload sequence taking
approximately 60-90 seconds. The third aft firing torpedo tube mounted in the saucer section for separated flight mode was removed
during refit when the ability to separate was eliminated. The Gallant also has the ability to handle the new FQ-1 quantum torpedoes
for use against threat forces.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The Gallant sports the most up to date lab and sensor facilities the fleet has to offer, and is fully
equipped to carry out any number of diplomatic functions. For crew and passenger safety, the vessel incorporates lifeboat and shuttle
facilities to evacuate the ship’s standard compliment three times over. The computer systems aboard the Gallant is a standard
ioslinear circuitry makeup in a traditional triple redundant configuration with some dedicated processing space made up of a hybrid
bio-neural/isolinear design for high speed processing. This is to provide computing power for the complex warp field dynamics
demanded by the Gallant’s unique external layout.

Development and Construction History: After her near destruction near Starbase 20, the Gallant was taken to Utopia Planitia and
refit to her current configuration. On stardate 4/7704.12 with much fanfare, the vessel was rechristened a Gallant-class starship,
the first and probably last of her kind.

   When the Galaxy-class starship was designed in the late 2340s to 2350s, it was envisioned that the twelve vessels of the class
would lead Starfleet’s exploratory efforts well into the next century. While the Galaxy-class has performed this task admirably, it was
felt early on that the potential of the design’s hull form had not been fully exploited. With the coming of the Borg in the early 2360s
and a full court push in progress to advance Starfleet’s tactical capability to counter the threat, Starfleet engineering went back to the
drawing board with the design. By 2368 the design for two vessels drawing on the Galaxy-class design specs were up for
consideration and were placed into production. These came to be known as the Frontier and Majestic class.

Classification: Like her Galaxy-class forbearers, the Frontier is classified as an Explorer.

Design: The Frontier is basically a reengineered, new incarnation of the Galaxy hull form. The Frontier-class modification of the
Galaxy-class spaceframe is intended to give the spaceframe greater endurance in extended missions, and the main differences are in
the use of internal space. The Frontier-class spaceframe devotes more internal area to ships stores, converting unused space into cargo
areas and more efficiently organizing laboratory and science spaces to minimize wasted space. Some of these modifications resulted
in the repositioning of certain shipboard systems and an altered weapons array. The sum total of all modifications resulted in a slight
increase in displacement over the standard Galaxy-class vessels while keeping the Frontier-class lighter than the Mythe-class
battlecruiser variant. As in older starship designs, the saucer separation capability has been removed, except with the use of explosive
bolts.

Engineering: The Frontier was among the first vessels designed with the FIUWR-1 (Federation Improved Warp type R/1) warp drive
from Shuvinaaljis Warp Technologies of Vulcan. Coupled with the proven FIG-3 impulse drive, the Frontier is a powerful and
maneuverable foe at both warp speed and subliminal velocities.

Tactical: While she is a ship of exploration, the Frontier is a child of the lessons learned from the Borg and Dominion, and her
design clearly reflects this. The tactical and damage control innovations found on the Frontier-class are among the most advanced in
the fleet, and easily rival those found in the Mythe-class battlecruiser. One of the strengths of the Frontier is her ability to provide
heavy sustained firepower at great distances. This ability is due in thanks to the new long range FH-10A phaser system from MinTech
Armaments. The Frontier also sports a modified version of the venerable FP-10 torpedo launch system, which has a 20% greater
launch capacity per torpedo spread. Late in the construction phase of the USS Frontier the decision was made to mount the new FQ-1
quantum torpedo launcher in a retracting bay in place of the captain’s yacht, and all downstream vessels were altered to reflect this
change. Able to track targets through a full 300° range of motion, the FQ-1 adds a sizeable kick to the Frontier’s power projection
capability. These weapon systems, coupled with the incorporation of abalative armor into the hull, and the heavy FSW-2 deflector
shield system, make the Frontier-class a deadly foe in combat.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The Frontier-class starships sport the most sophisticated and up to date lab facilities and sensor
suites of any vessels in the fleet, and are also fully equipped to carry out any number of diplomatic functions. Note that because of its
extended science missions in uncharted regions, and due to the fact that the class has eliminated the saucer separation capability, the
Frontier-class ships do not carry civilians. Frontier-class vessels also carry a disproportionate number of officers due to the large
number of science officers on board. The exclusion of civilians in the ship’s design has allowed the Frontier to sport much more
luxurious crew quarters than on the standard Galaxy-class. A combination of shipboard lounges, athletic facilities and holodecks



                                                                  122

make the Frontier a sought after assignment indeed. The computer systems aboard the six vessels of the class are a mixture of bio-
neural/isolinear circuitry in a traditional triple redundant configuration. The Frontier-class ships also mount the innovative
Emergency Holographic Anti-incursion program, designed to counter boarding attempts and for rapid internal security response. The
EHA is also tied to the EMH for ship wide supplemental medical services. These systems have been modified to cover nearly 80% of
the vessel’s internal volume.

Development and Construction History: The Frontier-class was produced at the San Francisco and Utopia Planitia shipyards, and
Earth Stations Everest and McKinley from 2369-2379 with six units in all constructed. All remain in active service.

   Starfleet’s plan to retire the Oberth-class surveyors with the introduction of the Galaxy-class in the early 2360s failed to take flight
due to the early loss of several of those vessels soon after their commissioning. It was not until almost fifteen years later following the
introduction of the Frontier and Majestic classes that Starfleet was able to revisit their plan to scrap the Oberths, yet losses during the
Dominion War threatened to delay this plan once again. Wartime production had postponed the introduction of the Pulsar-class in
favor of heavier, more combat capable designs, and once the war ended Starfleet was able to return to its primary mission of
exploration. To kick off their new focus, the long delayed Pulsars were returned to the shipyard for fitting out and a completely new
design lay laid down from plans drawn up before the war. In time, this new class would be christened Luna.

Classification: The Luna’s primary focus is the long range surveying of new worlds and deep space phenomena. As such, she is
designated as an exploration cruiser.

Design: The Luna follows a design evolution that directly descends from the Sovereign and Akira-class starships. Her elongated
saucer section features a buried bridge deck much like the Akira with nacelles and a tactical pod to match. The secondary hull is fairly
uncluttered thanks to the externalization of the torpedo launchers and long-range sensors, something that any ship’s engineer would be
able to appreciate. The fore view is clean and presents a low target profile for any vessel wishing to challenge the Luna.

Engineering: The Luna’s multi-refracting warp core emphasizes range over speed and gives the vessel a cruising range nearly 40%
greater than comparable sized vessels. Her cruising speed of warp 6.8 is a bit faster than most line starships, though her top
emergency speed of warp 9.75 is a step down from other vessels with a similar mission profile. At sublight speeds the Lunas fairly
nimble thanks to her twin thrust vectoring impulse drives.

Tactical: Like the Oberth before her, the Luna emphasizes her exploratory and research functions rather than an impressive tactical
suite, but the vessels of the class carry an impressive capability for self-defense. Her FH-16 phaser array provides incredible coverage
and is able to do so while keeping any aggressors at arms length. Her torpedo array is a full 50% more capable than the type carried
aboard the Intrepid-class, one of the few shortcomings of that design. Early plans called for the inclusion of a scaled down version of
the Majestic-class’ quantum torpedo launcher, but this was eventually dropped in favor on expanding the ship’s sensor suite.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: Service aboard the Luna-class vessels is a popular assignment thanks to her spacious crew
accommodations and extensive recreational facilities. Her long periods between port visits necessitate these facilities and are greatly
appreciated by her crews. The massive deck four crew lounge features a comfortable setting where officers and crewmen alike can
share a drink, play billiards or enjoy a meal freshly prepared in one of Starfleet’s few remaining shipboard galley’s. The computer
system aboard ship were lifted virtually unmodified from the Intrepid-class and provide exceptional processing ability for the ship’s
researchers and long range sensors.

Development and Construction History: Of the eight Luna-class vessels built to date, all remain in active service. Production is
expected to continue at various yards throughout the Federation until the initial contracted batch of 15 vessels are complete. As each
Luna come on line and assumes her duties, two Oberth-class vessels are pulled from service and assume their place along the final
frontier.

   When the Galaxy-class of starships were designed in the late 2340s to 2350s, it was envisioned that the twelve vessels of the class
would lead Starfleet’s exploratory efforts well into the next century. While the Galaxy-class has performed this task admirably, it was
felt early on that the potential of the design’s hull form had not been fully exploited. With the coming of the Borg in the early 2360s
and a full court push in progress to advance Starfleet’s tactical capability to counter the threat, Starfleet engineering went back to the
drawing board with the design. By 2368 the blueprints for two vessels drawing on the Galaxy-class design specs were up for
consideration and were eventually placed into production. These came to be known as the Majestic and Frontier-class.

Classification: Like her Galaxy-class forbearers, the Majestic is classified as an Explorer.

Design: The Majestic is a cut down and reengineered Galaxy hull form. The engineering section is virtually identical to the Galaxy
with minor changes to its internal arrangement. The connecting dorsal joining the engineering section and saucer was all but removed
and the two were mated directly without a provision for separation. Additionally, the saucer was also reoriented 90° with the internal
spaces and external features altered accordingly. The orientation of the saucer is not so much an aesthetic choice, but is an attempt to
decrease the fore and aft target aspect. With the removal of the saucer separation connects and related equipment, the loss of the
connecting dorsal is barely noticeable. In fact, internal habitable volume is only 2% less than the Galaxy-class.

Engineering: The Majestic was among the first vessels designed with the FIUWR-1 (Federation Improved Warp type R/1) warp
drive from Shuvinaaljis Warp Technologies of Vulcan. Coupled with the proven FIG-4 impulse drive, the Majestic is a powerful foe
at both warp speed and subluminal velocities.

Tactical: One of the strengths of the Majestic is her ability to provide sustained firepower at great distances. This ability is due in
thanks to the new long range FH-16 phaser system from HiBeam Energies. Coupled with the proven FP-10 torpedo launch system in
a fore/aft arrangement, the Majestic is a formidable adversary. During the construction phase of the Majestic and Repulse in 2372, the
new FQ-1 quantum torpedo launcher was added in a retracting bay in place of the captain’s yacht. Able to track targets through a full
300° range of motion, the FQ-1 adds a sizeable kick to the Majestic’s power projection capability. Potemkin and Kearsarge were
modified during their construction to take advantage of several tactical and damage control innovations brought about by the Mythe-
class battlecruiser. While normally employed as a ship of exploration, the Majestic is a child of the lessons learned from the Borg and
Dominion, and her design clearly reflects this. Along with the Frontier-class, the Majestic is the first explorer fit with a CIC
(Command and Control) suite. While normally not in use, the CIC can be quickly staffed and coordinate the movements of an entire
sector if need be.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The Majestic–class sports the most up to date lab and sensor facilities the fleet has to offer, and
is fully equipped to carry out any number of diplomatic functions. The inclusion of civilians aboard the Majestic was eliminated early
in the design phase when the ability to separate the saucer section was discarded. The computer systems aboard the five vessels of the
class are a mixture of bio-neural/isolinear circuitry in a traditional triple redundant configuration. The EMH system has been further
modified to cover nearly 70% of the vessel’s internal volume with backups located in the emergency triage and evacuation stations.

Development and Construction History: The Majestic-class was produced at Terran and Sol IV shipyards from 2369-2379 with
five units constructed in all. All remain in active service.

Historical Notes: The starship Concordia participated in the largest mass evacuation of a planet in Federation history in 2380.
Scientists on Dakara II had been performing seismic tests on the core of their planet to study the collapse of massive magnetic
fields. When one of their supposedly harmless tests got out of control, the molten core of the planet began to solidify
which in turn triggered a planet wide environmental disaster. With the planet coming apart around them, six Starfleet vessels,
led by the Concordia, evacuated the entire colony in a three week period. At times, the population of the Concordia reached
the 20,000 mark for the two day trip to the refugee station on Starbase 265. The Concordia made nine such trips and in the end
the entire population of Dakara, over 500,000 individuals, were saved from their dying world. Afterwards, the Concordia went in
for a two month overhaul for maintenance on her overtaxed systems. The independent scientists responsible for the
calamity were eventually brought up on charges of gross negligence and barred from any work within the Federation.

    With the coming of the age of the Galaxy-class starship, Starfleet realized that they had produced an incredible strategic and
exploration asset. However, the cost and size of the vessel made the construction of no more than a handful of units economical. So,
instead of pushing forward with a relatively small number of expensive hulls, Starfleet experimented with other designs. Drawing
from the technical innovations made during the Galaxy-class Starship Development Project, Starfleet introduced the Challenger, Iowa,
Nebula and Mosby-class starships.
    The Mosby was initially envisioned as a 3/4 Galaxy, a rule which was to be incorporated in nearly all her systems. Although she
incorporates the same warp drive, sensor suites and lab facilities as the Galaxy, the Mosby's tactical system is mostly older off the
shelf equipment. While the Mosby may not be suited for front line combat duty, she has proven herself time and again in the last
fifteen years as one of the most capable explorers in Starfleet history.

Classification: The Mosby is classified as an explorer with a secondary emphasis on tactical support missions.

Design: The saucer section is a slightly scaled down version of the type used aboard the Galaxy-class. The secondary hull contains
the engines, fuel tanks and support systems needed to keep the vessel operating. The saucer separation/reconnect capability was
retained for this class as the inclusion of civilians was an integral part of the vessel’s design.

Engineering: The Mosby directly benefited from the impressive warp drive innovations coming out of the Galaxy project. The
FUWA-1 m/am reactor is capable of driving the Mosby at speeds approaching warp 9.6 for 12 hours or a cruising speed of warp 6.
Three small but powerful FIF-3 impulse drives provide adequate maneuvering and auxiliary power for a vessel of the Mosby’s size.
Plans for the next few years call for replacing these drives with a more powerful version with extra power reserves.

Tactical: The weapons system is a near copy of the type used aboard the Excelsior and is adequate considering the Mosby’s mission
scope. The FH-11 phaser system is a tried and true array that has been in use for nearly a century. The FP-4 torpedo launcher was
chosen over the more modern FP-10 at a time when production shortages of the newer type were foreseen. The FSS-3 shield system
was borrowed from the Ambassador, but it is beginning to show its age. Updates for all tactical systems are planned for each
constructed vessel’s 20 year refit cycle.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The Mosby was designed from the outset with civilians in mind and is a well appointed vessel.
Assignment to these starships is a popular duty for researchers and those following a career track toward command. The computer
system is of the type pioneered aboard the Galaxy and is ample for the vessel’s needs.




                                                               129

Development and Construction History: Of the 14 Mosby-class starships built, all remain in service. The Mosby was produced at a
rate of one a year at several facilities throughout the Federation with primary consideration for 40 Eridani and Utopia Planitia. One
vessel, the USS James Doolittle, maintains a Starfleet tradition of having an almost all Vulcan crew. The planned fifteenth Mosby-
class starship was redesigned and commissioned as the USS Atheron in 2380 as a one of a kind technology demonstrator.

Historical Notes:
The Mosby-class starships are named for historical military leaders or other notable figures. The Mosby herself is named for the
Confederate States of America cavalry officer John Singleton Mosby, General Robert E. Lee's most praised officer. Other notable
names from Starfleet history include the starships Robert April, William G. Larson, James Sandecker and Robert Wesley. Except
where applicable, the vessels are referred to by the namesake's last name only.

In 2378, the starship Arleigh Burke was awarded to the winner of the Sagan Award for an eighteen month deployment in unexplored
space. The winners, a research team of 33 astrophysics students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, were given the starship
to help complete their studies. The event marked the first time a full-fledged starship had been assigned as the prestigious Sagan
Award prize.

On stardate 4/7906.30, the USS Nathan Hale was part of a surveying effort to create a detailed map and resource guide to the Pargelis
Cluster in Beta quadrant. Unknown to them, the Romulan Warbird Haladon was in the region not only surveying the cluster, but
building a listening outpost to eavesdrop on Klingon space. With tensions already strained by the ongoing conflict over the Raven
system, the Haladon immediately pounced on the Nathan Hale to cover up her actions. The science vessel was hard pressed to
counter the attack and took massive damage in the exchange. In particular, her saucer section was nearly gutted by multiple torpedo
strikes that left the vessel structurally unable to go into warp. With no other choice, Captain Thesses Haaro ordered the crew to
evacuate to the stardrive and separated the saucer section. Shed of the dead weight of the burning saucer section, the stardrive
evacuated the scene with the entire ship’s compliment and made for the safety of friendly space. The Nathan Hale would be out of
commission for over a year and a half while a new saucer was constructed.

   The Nebula-class project finds its roots in the waning days of the Galaxy-class design phase in 2347. Starfleet realized that the
Galaxy would be a phenomenal success, but its cost limited the fleet to six, or at most twelve hulls. To counter this, Starfleet
Engineering drew on the new technologies coming out of the Galaxy design to build a slightly smaller yet cost effective supplement to
the new multimission behemoths. With an emphasis on speed and flexibility, the Nebula-class has proven itself as one of the most
versatile in the fleet.




                                                               132

Classification: The Nebula-class is categorized as a multimission exploration cruiser.

Design: The Nebula’s saucer section is a virtual copy of the one produced for the Galaxy-class with nominal changes to the aft
sections and the removal of the impulse drives. The engineering hull is attached to the primary hull with twin nacelles trailing out and
down from the vessel in a manner similar to the venerable Miranda-class starships. Although the secondary hull is laid out in a
manner similar to the Galaxy-class, it is unusually cramped with more room taken up by fuel tanks and storage. The lost space is
made up for by the massive pod mounted above the saucer section on a column that rises along the aft portion of the ship. Mission
specific sensor pallets, the primary photon torpedo arrays, experiment packages and emergency stores are arranged here in easy to
modify prefabricated modular units. The initial plan was to have a dozen different swappable pod types that could be changed by any
starbase for specific mission, but this was deemed to be too costly for immediate implementation. It would be another twenty years
until the Trafalgar-class starships (a design based on the Nebula) would make this idea a reality.

Engineering: The warp drive system aboard the Nebula is a hybrid of technologies from the Galaxy design phase and an older design
from the proven Ambassador-class. The FIUWA-2 (Federation-Improved Warp type A/2) drive system is capable of driving the
Nebula at warp 9.5 with a warp 6 cruising speed. Impulse power is provided by twin FIG-2 fusion reactors mounted in the fantail at
the base of the pod support column.

Tactical: The FH-15 collimated phaser array and FP-10 torpedo launchers aboard the Nebula are identical to the system found on the
Galaxy. While the Nebula’s rate of fire and coverage is slightly less than the Galaxy’s, the two are a near match in the tactical arena.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: For an explorer, the Nebula-class is a well-appointed vessel. With a volume similar to the
Galaxy, the crew compliment is nearly 180 crewmen less making her crew quarters very comfortable. Designed around the inclusion
of families and civilians, the shipboard education, recreational and support systems are second to none. For a vessel designed for deep
space exploration and long-range patrol duty, these amenities are a necessity in regions far from a starbase or friendly territory. While
the Block 1 Nebula-class sports the standard isolinear computer system, the Block 2s, starting with the USS Canberra have an all
bioneural makeup with an isolinear backup.

Development and Construction History: Nebula-class starships are still in production and are built at a rate of two per year at
numerous facilities throughout the Federation. Current plans call for a total of 60 of these starships with an option for fifteen more.
Of the 54 Nebulas constructed, 38 remain in active service with one, the USS Trenton serving with Starfleet Training command.

   The Pulsar-class project was an attempt in the mid-2370s to improve upon the technologies emerging from the Sovereign-class.
While the Sovereigns have proven themselves to be capable explorers and defensive assets, they are some of the most costly starships
in existence. The Pulsar’s design is akin to the Galaxy/Nebula relationship, a complimentary design to fill in for the larger ship’s lack
of numbers. In the years since its introduction, the Pulsar has proven itself to be a valuable asset to Starfleet.

Classification: The Pulsar is classified as an explorer with a secondary tactical support role.

Design: The design of the Pulsar draws heavily from the Sovereign and Nebula-class vessels. The saucer section is a reengineered
version of the type used for the Sovereign. A greatly truncated secondary hull contains the warp core, navigational deflector, fuel
storage and main shuttlebay. Employing an external pod configuration similar to the type found aboard the Nebula-class makes up the
lost space. This massive structure contains the sensors, storage space and torpedo launchers necessary to support the ship.

Engineering: The proven FUWR-2 warp drive powers twin nacelles at the vessel’s sides for speeds up to warp 9.75 for 12 hours or a
cruising speed of warp 6. The twin FIH-1 fusion reactors provide ample maneuvering and auxiliary power.

Tactical: The Pulsar sports a phaser array that is as all encompassing and deadly as the system mounted aboard the Galaxy-class.
The FP-10 torpedo tubes mounted in the pod provide a devastating backup punch and are capable of utilizing both standard and
quantum torpedoes. Although the pod system is not the swapable version used in the Trafalgar-class, the sensor suite can be switched
out for any number of configurations at any reasonably equipped starbase within hours. This ability allows the Pulsar to employ
intelligence gathering and tactical support sensors for any number of fleet support missions.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: With a design emphasis on automated support systems and cruising range, the Pulsar’s crew
compliment is small for such a large vessel. This allows for crew comforts and amenities that far outclass many vessels of the same
size. Assignment to a Pulsar-class vessel is a popular duty and is considered a fast track to promotion. The computer system
employed by the Pulsar is an all bioneural makeup with an isolinear backup.

Development and Construction History: The Pulsar was designed at Starfleet Engineering on Terra with initial construction taking
place at Utopia Planitia. Further construction has been distributed to numerous facilities throughout the Federation. An initial order
for fifteen units has been approved with an open option for 10 more. Of the twelve Pulsars constructed to date, all remain in active
service.

   By the mid-2360s Starfleet was facing a crisis. Recent fleet downsizing had reduced the number of available vessels just as the
Romulans were beginning to reassert themselves into the Alpha Quadrant political scene and the Borg were making themselves known
as the next great threat. At that time Starfleet Engineering began work on a number of new vessel classes to counter these threats and
bolster the fleet’s numbers. One of the first vessels to go into production was the Sovereign-class starship, a vessel that would become
even more powerful (though less flexible) than the much vaunted Galaxy-class.

Classification: Although she is classified as an exploration cruiser, the Sovereign is more akin to a battlecruiser less the CIC and
marine contingent. Although she has a respectable capability for research and exploration she is rarely utilized in this manner.

Design: The Sovereign incorporates a distinctive look that is both familiar and at the same time revolutionary. Her blended hull
design greatly reduces the ships target profile while adding strength to her structural integrity. Although she carries no civilians, the
Sovereign is capable of separated flight mode, an outdated if not handy feature in an emergency situation. The remainder of the
vessel’s layout is the familiar saucer section, secondary hull and twin nacelle arrangement.

Engineering: The Sovereign-class designers took the revolutionary FUWR-1 warp drive a step further and heavily modified it for
their vessel’s massive spaceframe. The end result was a propulsion system with an output 33% better than the original with a top
emergency speed of warp 9.9 for twelve fours or a cruising speed of warp six. Her duel FIG-4 impulse drives are equally efficient and
propel the Sovereign impressively at sublight speeds despite her massive bulk.

Tactical: The tactical systems were constantly in flux during the entire design project and were not finalized until the last year of the
building process. The original plans called for the inclusion of the new FH-18 heavy phaser array as the vessel’s primary directed
energy weapon. However, development problems in the integration stage called for the triple mounting of the proven FH-15 and
fore/aft torpedo launchers with a capability 20% greater then the model mounted on the Galaxy. Late in the construction phase of the
USS Sovereign the new quantum torpedo launcher was added as an answer to the Borg’s virtual invulnerability to conventional photon
torpedoes.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The Sovereign sports the most up to date lab and sensor facilities the fleet has to offer, and is
fully equipped to carry out any number of diplomatic functions. The exclusion of civilians in the ship’s design has allowed the
Sovereign to sport some of the most luxurious crew quarters in the fleet. A combination of aboard shipboard lounges, athletic
facilities and holodecks make the Sovereign a comfortable assignment indeed. For crew and passenger safety, the vessel incorporates
lifeboat and shuttle facilities to evacuate the ship’s standard compliment twice over. The computer systems aboard the Sovereign-
class starships are a standard ioslinear circuitry makeup in a traditional triple redundant configuration. Later vessels of the class
incorporate a hybrid bio-neural/isolinear design for high speed processing.

Development and Construction History: The Sovereign enjoyed a short but successful production run of six vessels constructed
with all in active service to this day. An initial total of eighteen ships of the class were planned, but favor soon was turned to the
Frontier and Majestic classes, vessels who were slightly more costly but in the end are capable of a wider variety of duties.

   In 2373, Starfleet was facing a crisis. Two Borg invasions and a coming conflict with the Dominion was threatening to leave the
fleet unable to cope with the needs of the Federation. The engineering corps had long fought for a modular starship design that would
be flexible to meet any need the fleet may have. The plan was disregarded as logistically impractical and to expensive to mass
produce. However, times were changing and new ideas needed to be tried. The fleet's first attempt to construct a modular, front line
starship came to be known as the extraordinary Trafalgar-class.

Classification: Although she performs a wide variety of duties, the Trafalgar has been classified as an Explorer.

Design: The Trafalgar is a hybrid of starship components and incorporates the best the fleet has to offer. The class vessel started life
as a Nebula-class starship that was 25% of the way into construction. To take into account varying mission pod configurations with
differing warp field geometry needs, the nacelles were moved outboard and parallel to the primary hull. The external pod connect
pylon was widened and reinforced with umbilical, consumable and crew access lines to accommodate the pod's varying mission
profiles. Construction continued along these lines as Starfleet R&D worked on designing various mission pods.

Engineering: The Trafalgar receives primary propulsion from its FUWR-1 (Federation Warp Drive type R/1) warp drive capable of
a cruising speed of warp 6 or emergency speeds of warp 9.75. Impulse power is provided by twin FIG-2 fusion reactors mounted in
the saucer section’s trailing edges. It was deemed necessary to move the impulse drives to the saucer section due to the increased load
bearing requirements of the pod supports

Tactical: The weapons and tactical systems aboard the Trafalgar are state-of-the-art and reflect many of the design innovations of the
past 10 years. The primary phaser array is two saucer mounted FH-18 collimators covering a 300° arc around of the ship. Backup
firepower is provided by longer range but less powerful FH-16 phasers capable of tracking targets from any approach angle. The
primary hull is not equipped with a traditional photon torpedo launcher as a space saving measure. Instead, launch capabilities are
built into the swapable mission pods mounted above the saucer section. The rate of fire and coverage of these launchers varies from
pod type to pod type and depends on the vessel’s specific mission profile.




                                                                 139

Crew Support/Computer Systems: For an explorer, the Trafalgar-class is a well appointed vessel. Her internal volume is similar to
the Galaxy-class, though the crew compliment is nearly 200 less making her quarters quite plush. Designed around the inclusion of
families and civilians, the Trafalgar’s educational, recreational and support systems are second to none. For a vessel designed for
deep space exploration and long-range patrol duty, these amenities are a necessity in regions far from a starbase or friendly territory.
All Trafalgar-class starships are fit with the latest bioneural circuitry with a triple redundant isolinear backup system.

Development and Construction History: The Trafalgar-class was developed at Utopia Planitia on Mars. Of the eleven vessels of
the class constructed, all remain in active service. Distribution facilities for the Trafalgar’s mission pods are spread throughout the
Federation with maintenance and building of additional modules taking place at nearly two dozen locations. A list of available service
modules and their capabilities/functions are as follows:

           Balanced Operations Pod
                Includes a standard sensor suite with fore/aft torpedo launchers. This unit is a copy of the one used aboard the
                Nebula-class starships and is the most common type in service.

           Research Pod
                Mounts a enhanced sensor suite for exploration missions that can be reconfigured with specific sensor pallets.
                Includes crew quarters, facilities and lab space for 50 mission specialists. Mounts a fore mounted torpedo launcher
                with a magazine and launch capacity 50% that of the Balanced Operations Pod.

           Combat Operations Pod
               Fit with combat oriented tracking sensor for enhanced tactical operations, fore/aft torpedo launchers (standard
               configuration and magazine), and two collimated phaser strips with auxiliary fusion generators for additional power.

           Intelligence Platform
                  Fit with enhanced long range passive sensors for intelligence gathering purposes. Includes crew quarters for 50
                  mission specialists and their equipment. Also mounts sensor jamming equipment and other low observability
                  technologies. Includes rudimentary fore/aft torpedo/probe launchers.

           Marine Transport
               Includes quarters for 500 marines, their equipment, training facilities and 8 “Hopper” combat shuttles.
               Also mounts rudimentary fore/aft torpedo/probe launchers. Mounts ten combat transporters with their associated
               computer facilities, buffer tanks and support technicians.

           Emergency Evacuation Pod
               Capable of carrying up to 30 additional shuttles with temporary housing for 10,000 evacuees. Also includes ten
               emergency transporters with their associated computer facilities, buffer tanks and support technicians.

           Rescue/Hospital Ship
                Features emergency triage and surgical suites for 500 individuals with an EMH backup. Includes shuttle facilities for
                up to ten additional transports, 6 personnel transporters, and an independent power supply and lift support.

           Colony Transport
                Capable of carrying 1500 colonists and their equipment. Once at their new home, the pod can separate from the
                vessel and land on a planetary body to act as the colony’s initial base of operations. Once in place, the pod is
                incapable of further flight operations.

           Shuttle Carrier
                Capable of deploying as many as 80 shuttles and up to 8 runabout sized vessels. Includes crew quarters for 150
                mission specialists.

           SWACS (Spaceborne Warning and Control System)
              Utilizes sensors with triple the normal active sensor range, doubles passive sensor range, and carries jammers
              other low observability technologies. Includes full CIC facilities with crew quarters for 50 mission specialists and
              rudimentary fore/aft torpedo/probe launchers.

           Cargo Transport

Chandley-class Frigate




   In the opening days of the Dominion War, it became apparent that the conflict would be a long, protracted affair that would eat up
men and material at a devastating rate. From the outset, Starfleet was short of a number of fleet support assets, namely escorts and
hospital ships. The existing stock of active service vessels were simply incapable of performing the task before them, and the fleet
turned to the reserve of deactivated vessels at Memory Beta for a solution. Along with the Andor class, the Chandley class frigates
were among the first vessels pulled from their parking orbits for refit

Nomenclature: Although they were originally commissioned with proper names and registries, this publication has chosen to omit
them, as their inclusion would be impractical.

Classification: When they first entered service in the late 2280s, the Chandley was designated as a frigate. However, wartime refits
diversified the vessel’s functions to include medical support services and assault ship.

Design: The Chandley’s famous “wing” assemblies proved to be a boon for engineers looking for ways to diversify the vessel’s
capabilities. For some ships, the vessel was simply refurbished and deployed as-is while others had this space refit as hospital and
combat triage facilities. Massive barracks and weapon storage spaces gave way to surgical suites and isolation wards capable of
treating up to 200 patients at a time.

Engineering: Upon their reactivation in 2373, the Starfleet Engineers in charge of the refit project set their sites on integrating the
Chandley with the new FUWE-2 warp drive. This lightweight and easily modified drive would increase the Chandley’s top speed
from a paltry warp 8 to warp 9.4 with a cruising speed of warp 6. The addition of a second impulse drive further added to the
Chandley’s maneuverability and helped push the vessel’s power reserves to 100% above what the first vessels of the class could
expect upon commissioning. Along with the new drive systems came a whole new structural integrity field generator scheme that
helped to further increases the Chandley’s rigidity and durability during battle.

Tactical: Although they are considered bulky and maintenance intensive by modern standards, the Chandley’s early model FH-11
phasers were retained on all version of the class as her primary defensive weapon. The primary torpedo launchers were refit to
accommodate the newer FP-10 type and helped to increase her rate of fire in all respects. The hospital ship version of the Chandley
chose to omit the torpedo launchers altogether in favor of expanding the vessel’s cargo capacity. Her reworked FSS-2a shield
generators are a bit underpowered considering the vessel’s mission scope, but engineers had difficulty with the existing power
distribution systems during refit and chose a faster refit time over additional protection.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: : One of the priorities in the Chandley’s refit process was the reduction of the vessel’s crew
requirements. Manpower shortages were taking their toll on the fleet and the last thing Starfleet needed to deal with was vessels idle
in spacedock merely because there was no one available to take them into battle. The answer was to automate as many of the
Chandley’s maintenance and engineering systems as possible to reduce her personnel requirements. A hundred years of computer and
automation system advances allowed just that, and her crew compliment went from 240 to a mere 190. These wartime refits allowed
for the inclusion of few amenities and they are mostly devoid of luxuries. Fortunately the units that were retained for service were
completed to modern specifications in the years since and the crews are well accommodated. Her computer system was almost
completely removed and replaced with a much smaller but vastly more powerful isolinear based core with a hybrid bioneural backup
for high-speed performance.

Development and Construction History: The Chandley originally entered service in 2277 with nearly 250 units eventually being
commissioned. Wartime and other losses accounted for 44 of the class’ numbers before a mass retirement starting in 2314 and ending
in 2318. Of those vessels, all but 120 were scrapped or sold to the Corillian States as surplus. Mothballed vessels were retained at
Memory Beta, the fleet's primary starship retirement and storage depot, a facility that was established in 2273. The Chandleys were
then maintained and inspected biannually to ensure their long term viability for future reactivation. When the call went out to
reactivate nearly 800 of the various vessels stored there for the war effort, the process was virtually effortless. The reactivations were
mostly handled in house at Memory Beta, but a number of special cases were farmed out to various fleet yards throughout the
Federation. The rate of reactivation was an average of six Chandleys per month with a turnaround time of three months until the
existing stockpile of mothballed vessels were exhausted. With the post war downsizing the bulk of the reactivated ships went back
into mothballs or were sold to the Corillian States. Other ships that were too damaged or worn for salvage were sent to the breakers
yard. Even years after the cessation of hostilities 14 Chandley-class vessels remain in active service, 18 in the reserves with another
25 held in storage at Memory Beta. They are a mix of the frigate refits and medical support ship modifications. 20 medical ships
versions of the Chandley were sent to the Romulans in a lend-lease arrangement during the Dominion War, and they eventually
returned 12 of the vessels, six having been destroyed and two defecting to the Romulan Free States.

   Although she is by no means one of the most glamorous vessels in Starfleet service, the Chimera-class destroyer has stood on the
front lines of Federation defense unwaveringly for thirty years. Born out of necessity from the lessons learned in the conflict with the
Tholians in the 2340s, the Chimera is a utilitarian design with few amenities and nothing but a rugged construction to fall back on.
The Chimera is one of the most successful designs to come out of the design facilities at Antares Fleet Yards and her versatility is a
testament to her designer’s foresight.

Classification: The Chimera is classified as a destroyer with an emphasis on fleet support operations and long duration border
interdiction.

Design: The design for the Chimera began, oddly enough, with a broken model. One of the yard engineers at Antares Fleet Yards
had been the chief construction foreman on three previous Excelsior-class starships over his career and had a model of that vessel on
his desk. A janitor cleaning his desk accidentally broke the fragile model one night and the remains were set to be recycled.
However, the engineer, upon seeing his prize model in pieces, began experimenting with various nacelle arrangements and hull
configurations with the model that was now in several manageable sections. Within the next week he had completed the warp
dynamics modeling of one of his inspired configurations and had permission to proceed with full-scale development within the month.
From toy to prototype, the whole process took less than a year.

Engineering: To accommodate the new hull form, the FIWA-1 warp drive was discarded in favor of the lighter FIWD-1 from the
Renaissance-class with a resulting top speed of warp 9.6 for 12 hours. To save space, the Chimera utilizes a horizontal warp intermix
chamber, the first fit aboard a Federation starship in fifty years due to its fickle maintenance needs. However, the advancements of the
last half-century made this a moot point for the Chimera and the design is no more difficult to maintain than any other vessel in the
fleet. Impulse power is provided by the very reliable FIG-2 impulse drive for superb performance at sublight speeds.




                                                                 145

Tactical: The Chimera’s weapons array is the envy of any other destroyer class in the fleet, even the modern Hurricane and Spitfire
classes of the last ten years. Her seven saucer mounted FH-10 phaser banks provide a massive directed energy punch in the forward
arc with her FP-4 torpedo launchers providing a rapid fire backup punch. The only drawback is the lack of aft mounted weaponry,
and the class relies on a single phaser array to cover that arc. However, the Chimera is designed to fight on the offensive and this has
rarely been a drawback for ship captains in the past.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The Chimera is a fairly crowded vessel and free space is tight aboard ship. However, the crew’s
recreational needs are overseen by some of the first ship-mounted holodecks in the fleet along with ample lounge and common areas.
While the Chimera’s are only rarely sent on survey or research missions, they are often called upon for extensive border patrols with
long periods between port visits. The computer core fit aboard ship is the same type developed for the Fletcher-class destroyer and is
adequate for the Chimera’s needs.

Development and Construction History: Of the thirty Chimeras built between 2350 and 2359, twenty-two are in active service. No
further vessels of the class are planned, and they are expected to remain a part of the active fleet for another forty years.

                 Santiago      Scrapped after striking a Dominion War era gravitic mine near Starbase 375 on stardate 4/7809.

One of the legacies of the Federations three-year war with the Dominion was a proliferation of minefields meant to protect vast
regions from unwanted intrusions. Dominion mines are powerful and difficult to sweep, but in the years following the war it was a
task that had to be accomplished. To this end, numerous destroyers and smaller combatant vessels were fit with dedicated
minesweeping equipment to locate and neutralize the mines one at a time. The USS Santiago was one such vessel, and had been
operating in this capacity for more then a year without incident. While sweeping near Starbase 375, the Santiago was in the process of
dismantling a particularly heavy concentration of mines when the disaster occurred. The vessel had laid up along side a grouping of
mines and was disabling them with a tetrion beam when one of the mines fired its station-keeping thrusters and slammed into its
neighbor. That mines fuel reserve ruptured and showered the area with a heavy graviton burst from its damaged warhead. The
cascade continued when a nearby mine misinterpreted the accident as a passing vessel, fired its interceptor engine and dove on the
Santiago. Soon the Santigao was being swarmed by dozens of mines that were bent on her destruction. However, the vessel was
carrying mine detection gear that provided a small measure of safety and allowed her to get under way and leave the field.
Unfortunately, the gear wasn’t foolproof and the Santiago took numerous direct hits after a five-minute flight for safety. With her hull
breached in no less than nine places and both warp nacelles gone, Captain Leslie Cordean ordered the Santiago abandoned before the
vessel was completely destroyed. Only 78 of the vessel’s compliment survived the disaster and Starfleet Engineering would
eventually fund a project that would allow the fields to be disabled using unmanned ships to reduce the risk to the minesweepers
crews.

Fletcher-class Destroyer




   The Fletcher-class destroyer was the right ship for the right time. Born at the outset of the Tholian conflict of the 2340s, the
Fletcher has proven itself as an invaluable part of the modern Starfleet task force. Easy to mass-produce and field, these vessels have
served in every major conflict fought by the Federation in the past 30 years.
   Based on the hull of the old Miranda-class cruiser, the Fletcher is a vessel devoid of amenities. Constantly in service, the ships get
pushed from Starbase to Starbase like chess pieces to protect convoys, act as couriers and partake in any thousands of odd jobs that an
Admiral can dream up. With a crew of only eighty-nine, the compliment can suddenly swell up tenfold in war time for the Fletcher's
secondary roll of troop carrier.

Classification: The Fletcher’s role as fleet support and screening vessel classifies her as a destroyer.

Design: The Fletcher’s design is a reengineered Miranda-class hull with most of the differences between the class being internalized.

Engineering: The engine arrangement and layout is based off the long since retired Mk IV Miranda-class starships that were in
service from the 2320s to 60s. Her FIWG-1 warp drive is a rapidly ageing design with serious endurance issues, but is reliable and
relatively easy to maintain in the field. Her dual FIG-1 impulse drives provide the Fletcher with impressive handling capabilities at
sublight speeds.

Tactical: Early designs for the Fletcher called for the ability for the hull to separate from the warp nacelles and weapons pylon. The
vessel then could descend to a planets surface to land and dismount her troops and their vehicles. The ship could then take off and
rejoin the drive section. This ability was built into the first two Fletcher-class ships with mixed results. During pre-commissioning
trials it was decided that there was no benefit to landing the troops as opposed to a traditional beamdown. Although they have had
little need to perform the separation maneuver over the years, the starships Fletcher and Radford have retained this ability.
     The Fletcher is purely a wartime asset and has little use in times of peace. Her sensor suite is almost rudimentary and is enough for
fighting and navigation, but is of little value otherwise. She is a true vessel of the heavy task force, depending on the flagship for
instructions and long-range tactical information.
    On the offensive, the Fletcher has an impressive set of FH-14a pulse phaser banks that until recently were useful only at relatively
short ranges. Fortunately, software and targeting upgrades in the mid-2360s increased their accuracy and range by almost 25% across
the board. Her backup FH-3 phaser system is still as reliable and accurate as it was over a century ago, though it is a bit under
powered by modern standards. The Fletcher’s dual fore/aft FP-4 torpedo launcher in the familiar roll-bar configuration is equally
reliable, although her rate of fire is far below modern vessels with similar mission profiles.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The vessels of the Fletcher-class are spartan to say the least and are unpopular assignments.
Lieutenant Commanders are usually in command with a small compliment of junior officers at his disposal with the rest of the crew
made up of regular crewmen.

Development and Construction History: Of the 175 Fletcher-class destroyers constructed, 103 remain in active service. Production
halted in 2376 following the Dominion War, and no others are planned for the immediate future.

   After the Borg invasion of 2367, Starfleet searched frantically for ways to shore up their depleted fleet. With the trend of the last
50 years leaning toward larger vessels emphasizing multimission support, the rate of vessel construction had ground to a crawl. With
a new enemy breathing down her neck and new adversaries seemingly at every turn, the fleet decided to return to the past, at least in
part. The SSDP Project (Small Starship Development Program) began in the later half of 2367 at the Utopia Planitia and 40 Eridani
Fleet Yards. The initial studies drew upon lessons learned from the Defiant/Pathfinder project and the recent Borg encounters. From
this project would eventually come the Intrepid, Patriot, Saint Louis and Heimdall-classes. There would also soon follow the very
successful Hurricane and Spitfire-class destroyers, the epitome of small vessel design.

Classification: The Hurricane-class is designated as a short-range tactical support vessel.

Design: The Hurricane’s design drew from the scaled down hull framing and Warp Field Dynamics testing of the Sovereign-class
which was at the time under development. The starship’s single nacelle is suspended over the saucer section with a truncated
secondary hull containing the engineering systems, fuel tanks, navigational deflector and shuttle bay.




                                                                 151

Engineering: The ultra efficient FUWR-2 warp drive system mounted on the Hurricane allows for very high warp speeds, an
impressive warp 9.85 for 12 hours with a cruising speed of warp 6.5. The twin FIG-3 impulse drives allow for above average
handling at subluminal velocities and suit the Hurricane‘s mission profile of close in fleet defense and screening duties. The lighter
units aboard the Spitfire provide less power but make it suitable for high speed flanking attacks on enemy formations.

Tactical: The Hurricane draws heavily on the Sovereign's tactical systems with a scaled down quantum torpedo launcher and military
operations sensor arrays. Cosmetically identical, the Hurricane and Spitfire diverge greatly in their engine configuration and phaser
load. While the Spitfire boasts a longer-range phaser array and sensor suite, the Hurricane's punch is much heavier up close
They were also fit with an impressive photon torpedo launch capability of a scale that is normally found on much larger starships.

Crew Support/Computer Systems Like most vessels designed with short-range support missions in mind, the Spitfire is devoid of
most luxuries. Its 192-man crew and 25 member Marine compliment are well accommodated, but most crew support facilities are
assumed to be available during the large amount of time the Hurricane spends at port. The standard isolinear computer system is
sufficient for the ship’s needs, and no enhancements are planned for the future.

Development and Construction History: The Hurricane was designed at Starfleet Engineering in San Francisco as a part of the
SSDP Project (Small Starship Development Program). Initial construction and fabrication was performed at the Utopia Planitia and
40 Eridani Fleet Yards.

           Brimstone     Destroyed by Dominion forces near Bajor on stardate 4/7312.
           Protector     Scrapped after a dockyard accident at Utopia Planitia, Mars on stardate 4/7709.
           Oakley        Destroyed by Dominion forces near Chin’toka on stardate 4/7405.
           Bowie         Destroyed by Dominion forces near Chin’toka on stardate 4/7405.
           Moratania     Destroyed by unknown alien forces in the Beta Orthon System on stardate 4/7907.

The USS Protector enjoyed a short but distinguished career in her three years with the fleet before it was tragically cut short on
stardate 4/7709. The vessel was in drydock at Utopia Planitia for routine maintenance when a catastrophic series of events led to the
starship’s undoing. As a part of her checkup, the ship’s entire impulse drive and RSC maneuvering system was being swapped out to
incorporate some new safety features. Ironically, it was the lack of propulsion that brought about the Protector’s demise. She was
being towed from her berth to a parking orbit to await parts when her tug suddenly lost power. Without maneuvering control, the
Protector’s transfer orbit soon turned into a collision course as the vessel was approaching some of the heaviest traffic above Mars.
With no other tugs available and the nearest operable starship on the other side of the planet, the Protector was on her own. With her
warp core powered down and cold the vessel was without primary power. The impulse drive was of course awaiting installation in a
crate on a freighter bound for Mars and her auxiliary power generators were off line. That left only the reserve battery, which was at
the time busy keeping the environmental systems going. In a moment of desperation, the Protector’s chief refit engineer ordered his
crew beamed off by ground installations while he remained aboard in an environmental suit. Now on a direct collision course with a
drydock containing an unfinished Nebula-class starship, he transferred the last of his power to the tractor beam and calmly waited for
the right time. At the last moment he engaged the tractor beam and used it to push against and away from the drydock. His plan
almost worked, and instead of a catastrophic head on collision only the secondary hull of the Protector struck the dock. With no way
to contain the damage by himself and fires breaking out throughout the ship he ordered himself beamed off while the Protector
continued on alone into a higher and for the time being safer orbit. When repair crews arrived on the vessel they found the ship was a
burnt out hulk and unsalvageable. She was sent to the breakers yards the following month. Ironically, the engineer who so
ingeniously averted disaster was later assigned as Chief Engineer to the very Nebula-class starship that he helped save, a reward for
his fast thinking and ingenuity.

   The designation “frigate” has for centuries been attributed to vessels whose role was primarily a supporting one. The New
Orleans-class is no exception to this rule, and has been a valued part of fleet operations for the past 30 years. Designed from the
outset as a heavy patrol craft and fleet support vessel, the New Orleans has also helped push back the borders of Federation space with
an admirable capability for exploration and research.

Classification: The New Orleans is classified as a frigate with a primary emphasis on fleet support operations.

Design: Several design elements of the New Orleans were precursors to the now famous Galaxy-class starships. The saucer section is
clearly the inspiration for that larger vessels design, albeit greatly enlarged. The secondary hull with its traditional twin nacelle
arrangement contains the engineering spaces and fuel tanks, a design familiar to most Federation starship classes

Engineering: The FIWD-1 warp drive fit aboard the New Orleans is the same type developed for the Renaissance-class when they
began experiencing overheating problems and microcrystalline fracturing in the dilithium chamber lining and injector ports with the
older FIWC series warp cores. This same drive unit, in a heavily modified and enlarged form, would later be the inspiration for the
FUWA-1 that was added to the Galaxy-class. Capable of propelling the vessel at warp 9.2 for 12 hours with a cruising speed of warp
6, the FIWD-1 has proven itself a reliable design. The real strength for the New Orleans is its twin FIG-2 impulse drives which
provide superb handling at sublight velocities. This ability was designed into the class to allow her to keep up with and even outpace
the fleet groups she was assigned to protect.

Tactical: While the New Orleans may not mount phaser arrays in great numbers, the FH-11s she does carry provide exceptional
coverage from virtually any approach angle. When the decision was made to add facilities for 100 marines, there was a mad scramble
among the project engineers to find space for the already overcrowded spaceframe. The eventual solution was to move the torpedo
launchers, consumables storage and mission specific sensor pallets into three outrigger pods, two on the saucer and one on the
stardrive. The space saved by the redesign more than made up for the space lost to the Marine detachment and allowed for additional
recreational and lab facilities.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The New Orleans is a long duration patrol and tactical operations vessel which necessitates the
addition of better than average crew amenities and living quarters. Designed in a time when the inclusion of families was being
emphasized for newly constructed starships, the New Orleans’ mission scope precludes their addition. The 100 member Marine
contingent rarely passes the 25 member mark except for specific missions or when on combat patrol. The computer systems aboard
these vessels are a standard isolinear type and are adequate for the vessel’s needs.

Development and Construction History: Of the 45 New Orleans-class vessels constructed between 2350 and 2378, 24 remain in
active service. Four of them, the Kyushu, Perry, Sumter and Orleans were lost to the Borg at the Battle of Wolf 359. Construction
took place at numerous facilities throughout the Federation with the bulk of the contracts going to Chandley Works on Mars and the
Antares Fleet Yards.

   After the Borg invasion of 2367, Starfleet searched frantically for ways to shore up their depleted fleet. With the trend of the last
50 years leaning toward larger vessels with multimission support, the rate of starship construction had ground to a crawl. With a new
enemy breathing down her neck and new adversaries seemingly at every turn, the fleet decided to return to the past, at least in part.
The SSDP Project (Small Starship Development Program) began in the later half of 2367 at the Utopia Planitia and 40 Eridani Fleet
Yards. The initial studies drew upon lessons learned from the Defiant/Pathfinder project and the recent Borg encounters. From this
project would eventually come the Intrepid, Patriot, Saint Louis and Heimdall-classes. There would also soon follow the very
successful Spitfire and Hurricane-class destroyers, the epitome of small vessel design.

Classification: The Spitfire-class is designated as a short-range tactical support vessel.

Design: The Spitfire’s design drew from the scaled down hull framing and Warp Field Dynamics testing of the Sovereign-class which
was at the time under development. The starship’s single nacelle is suspended over the saucer section with a truncated secondary hull
containing the engineering systems, fuel tanks, navigational deflector and shuttle bay.

Engineering: The ultra efficient FUWR-1 warp drive system mounted on the Spitfire allows for very high warp speeds, an
impressive warp 9.8 for 12 hours with a cruising speed of warp 7. The twin FIG-2 impulse drive allows for impressive handling at
subluminal velocities and makes it suitable for high speed flanking attacks on enemy formations. The more robust drive systems
aboard the Hurricane make that vessel more suited to close-in fleet defense and screening duties.

Tactical: The Spitfire draws heavily on the Sovereign's tactical systems with a scaled down quantum torpedo launcher and military
operations sensor arrays. Cosmetically identical, the Hurricane and Spitfire diverge greatly in their engine configuration and phaser
load. While the Spitfire boasts a longer-range phaser array and sensor suite, the Hurricane's punch is much heavier up close.
They were also fit with an impressive backup photon torpedo launch capability and rugged shielding.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: Like most vessels designed with short-range support missions in mind, the Spitfire is devoid of
most luxuries. Its 190-man crew and 25 member Marine compliment are well accommodated, but most crew support facilities are
assumed to be available during the large amount of time the Spitfire spends at port. The standard isolinear computer system is
sufficient for the ship’s needs, and no enhancements are planned for the foreseeable future.

Development and Construction History: The Spitfire was designed at Starfleet Engineering in San Francisco as a part of the SSDP
Project (Small Starship Development Program). Initial construction and fabrication was performed at the Utopia Planitia and 40
Eridani Fleet Yards. Of the 67 units produced, 52 remain in active service. Two Spitfires, the Cheetah and Mystere were destroyed
by the Borg at the Battle of Typhon. One, the USS Sidewinder, is serving with the Starfleet Training Command.

   In 2360, Starfleet undertook a massive fleet-wide retirement of older ship classes to cut costs and streamline operational efficiency.
At the same time, the vessels that had for so long served as the military backbones of the fleet were gone and the larger multimission
starships were called upon in their place. Instead of partaking in research or exploration missions, these valuable vessels would more
often than not be found patrolling the Romulan Neutral Zone or escorting a convoy near Orion space, and the Federation’s scientific
programs were suffering for it. To help stem the tide of vessels being moved to defensive missions, the Akira and Steamrunner-class
starships were drawn up as a stopgap, designs capable of scientific and military missions that were deemed to trivial for the larger
“prestige” vessels to be bothered with. Without question, the project has been a phenomenal success and both designs figured in
prominently in the defense of the Federation during the Dominion War of the 2370s.

Classification: Upon commissioning, the Steamrunner was designated a destroyer. However, her mission profiles of the last two
decades would more closely those of a light cruiser.




                                                                 161

Design: At a glance, the Steamrunner was clearly designed as a vessel that one would not wish to trifle with. To protect her vital
systems, the nacelles are enclosed in housing in the primary hull with the field coils trailing to the aft of the ship. Like the Akira, the
Steamrunner’s bridge deck is buried in a structural well that protects it from incoming fire unlike most other Federation designs.
Descending from the nacelles are twin pylons supporting the external deflector array, a design that not only optimizes its effectiveness
but frees up a massive amount of room in the primary hull.

Engineering: The Steamrunner incorporates the FUWR-1 warp drive that was so successfully introduced by the Akira-class just a
few years before. The drive coil assembly is a boon to the Steamrunner’s design as the placement of the two impulse drives
dramatically increases the vessel’s maneuverability. With the mass saving features of the FUWR-1, the Steamrunner is as surprisingly
nimble vessel for a starship of her size. Her top speed of warp 9.75 for twelve hours makes her ideal for task force operations and she
was a favorite of fleet commanders in the Dominion War.

Tactical: The inspiration for the tactical system aboard the Steamrunner came from the venerable Renaissance-class cruiser, a
starship that has proven itself time and again in engagements over the last forty years. Like the Renaissance, the Steamrunner’s
phaser array utilizes two power streams in the standard firing volley, a standard banked pair and with an additional third stream
providing a 33% increase in power throughput. If a rapid-fire mode is desired, the three beams can split off into a group of two with a
follow-up up single beam punch. This versatility has made the Steamrunner a favorite for task force operations. Although her FP-10
torpedo compliment is limited by a low rate of fire, her flexibility on the battlefield is unmatched.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: Because of her complicated primary system requirements, the Steamrunner is a manpower
intensive vessel making her fairly crowded by modern standards. However, the Steamrunners are popular with their crews and duty
aboard one is considered a prime assignment. The computer systems are a scaled down version of the type developed for the Galaxy-
class with starships launched after 2375 receiving bioneural processors for some of her primary computing needs

Development and Construction History: Of the thirty-five Steamrunner-class cruisers constructed, eighteen remain in active
service. Most of her operational losses are attributed to almost nonstop deployment during the Dominion War, and should not reflect
any defect in her overall design. New vessel production was suspended in 2378 with the last two hulls entering service in 2382.

   By this time, the origins of the Defiant-class escorts are no secret. The design came about during the terrifying twililght between
Starfleet’s first contact with the Borg at system J-25 and their apocalyptic assault at Wolf 395. Starfleet command was desperate for a
vessel that could be quick fabricated and fielded before these seeming unstoppable juggernauts could strike again. In the end though,
the class would find its greatest success against the Dominion during their alliance with the Cardassians and several other Alpha
Quadrant powers during the mid-2370s.

Classification: From the outset, the Defiant was designated as an escort, though her firepower and offensive nature put her in a class
unlike any other starship in Starfleet history.

Design: The Defiant possesses a unique blended hull design that serves to pull in all of the vulnerable equipment like the warp
nacelles and sensors array into a more compact and harder to damage arrangement. Her small size and narrow target cross-section
make her a particularly difficult target to lock onto and is perfectly suited for the sort of close in maneuvering needed when engaging a
comparatively immobile enemy capital ship.

Engineering: For such a small ship, the Defiant can draw upon a surprising wealth of engine power for her primary systems. The
FUWE-1 warp drive set the standard for small vessel design in the mid-2360s and is capable of propelling the diminutive escort at an
impressive emergency speed of warp 9.9. Her twin FIG-2 impulse drives are nearly too large for the Defiant’s diminutive layout and
literally hurl the ship about the battlefield at speeds that few vessels can match. Early engine tests of the class vessel nearly tore the
ship apart due to insufficient provisions for structural integrity field strength during the design phase. Eventually this problem was
overcome and later vessels benefited from the lessons learned during those risky early field trials.



                                                                  165

Tactical: Nearly two decades after her initial introduction into the fleet, several of the Defiant’s more exotic weapons systems remain
closely guarded secrets. However, her pulse phaser array is largely regarded as the most potent directed energy weapon every
deployed aboard a Starfleet vessel. This forward mounted array of four emitters are capable of laying down a field of fire that literally
slices through enemy shields and pulverizes their hull. They are frequency agile for more effective use against the Borg’s inherent
adaptability and are much easier to maintain in the field than traditional phaser mounts, a useful trait due to the Defiant’s small crew
compliment. Her fore mounted “weapon of last resort,” a pod containing enough explosives to lay waste to all but the largest Borg
cube, has never been utilized in battle. Despite this, the feature has been retained should the Borg ever make another move against the
Federation.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: Defiant-class vessels have reputations for being fierce combatants with dedicated and
hardworking crews. Unfortunately, the design of this vessel leaves little in the way of crew comforts, and in every way it is a
workingman’s ship. Long duration patrols are avoided wherever possible, for the lack of even the most rudimentary recreational
facilities aboard ship contributes heavily to crew fatigue. Sector commanders usually try to keep these vessel’s close to the vest to
allow their crews access to port facilities. Unfortunately this is not always possible, and most Defiant’s suffer from a high rate of
turnover among her crews, particularly in the enlisted ranks.

Development and Construction History: Of the 34 Defiant-class escorts produced between 2369 and 2379, 29 remain in active
service. Production ended with the commissioning of the USS Icarus and three incomplete hulls were mothballed at varying states of
completion. No further examples of the class are planned, though the three remaining hulls may be eventually fit out to replace any
further operational losses.

   The Bay-class destroyer escort was designed in the early 2360’s as a low cost, disposable light warship that was easy to build and
field in large numbers. The plan called for the major components of the vessel to be pre-assembled at ground based construction
facilities and completed in the ship fitter’s yard. With a life span projected at only 25 years, the vessels had to be cost effective, and
the pre-fabrication option optimized the project’s resources. While the “Throw Away Bay” is not the most powerful vessel in the
fleet, she is unquestionably one of the most prolific and has certainly met the need of a fleet desperately in need of multipurpose small
vessel support.

Classification: The Bay is classified as a destroyer escort.

Design: In order to facilitate the modular, prefabricated construction process into the Bay, the vessel is constructed of a small
secondary hull and enlarged saucer section. The saucer sports numerous access ports on the underside that can be pulled away to
swap out damaged components or install upgrades. The secondary hull features a “plug-in” warp core, a deflector array that can be
pulled out as a single component, and fuel storage bunkers that can be swapped out for storage containers for short-range cargo duty.
While the Bay carries no civilians, it does possess the capability to separate and reconnect its saucer section from the star drive for
independent operations. This is provided purely as a safety measure as the primary hull is unable to support itself in combat without
the maneuvering capabilities of the saucer’s impulse engines. This design feature has saved the lives of more than one Bay crew
whose battle damaged vessel was facing a warp core breach or other such catastrophe where evacuating in escape pods would have
proven pointless.

Engineering: The FUWE-1 warp core used aboard the Bay is a heavily modified version of the type developed for newly emerging
small vessel designs. Although it provides power similarly to her contemporaries, the Bay’s warp drive can propel the vessel at only
warp 9.4 for twelve hours. Her dual FIF-2 impulse drives are adequate for fleet operations at sublight speeds, but are criticized for
their disappointing auxiliary power generation capabilities.

Tactical: The primary role of the Bay is to provide fire support for the vessels she is escorting or to engage the enemy en-masse. Her
saucer mounted FH-10 phasers provide superb firepower from long ranges while her fore and aft FP-8 torpedo launchers do the dirty
work up close. Any Bay by itself is a weak warship and is barely capable of self-defense. However, the Bay’s are operated in groups
of six with a force commander coordinating the actions of all ships in a group. To this end, every sixth Bay that is built is equipped
with a CIC suite and pro visions for an eight member battle staff.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The Bay’s are small and crowded and service aboard them is unpopular. The primary outlet for
the crew’s recreational needs is a massive lounge area on deck 7 and two smaller lounges on deck 2 that feature floor to ceiling
observation windows that provide a superb view of the space outside the ship. These multipurpose lounges also serve as the ship’s
galley, triage center, temporary cargo bay, gymnasiums, and any other purpose the crew can dream up. The computer systems aboard
the Bay are a standard isolinear makeup.

Development and Construction History: Of the 204 Bay-class DDEs constructed, 179 remain in active service. Contracts are
spread out six at a time to various shipyards to maximize the transport of construction components from the master ground facilities
on Rigel IV and Terra. Construction has been approved at current rates for the foreseeable future as long as need dictates their
production. With the 20-year birth date of many of the class approaching, plans are being drawn up to either extend their service lives
another ten years through refurbishing operations or the sale of older models to the Corillian States.

Corvette-class Cutter




   The Corvette-class cutter was introduced to Starfleet service in 2367 as a low cost high speed interdiction vessel and convoy escort
craft. Smaller than a destroyer but far more capable than most inter-system monitors, the Corvettes are more than a match for any of
the major pirate clans plying the space lanes today. As an escort, the Corvette’s primary role is to absorb shots that might otherwise
be hitting the real ships, a grim but accurate description of their mission scope. Her secondary functions include light utility work,
rescue operations and commerce patrols, jobs that she is well suited for. In short, the Corvette’s are capable vessels and have served
the fleet well for fifteen years and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.

Nomenclature: Corvette-class vessels are rarely given proper names upon commissioning. However, they are often given nicknames
along with a ship’s emblem that is emblazoned on the warp nacelle pylon as a unique identifier. This system is analogous to the
artwork and names assigned to bomber and fighter units on Terra during the conflicts of the mid-late twentieth century. The vessels of
the class are entered into the fleet registry by their NCC number only and have been omitted here for clarity’s sake.

Classification: The Corvette is classified as a cutter, a designation that identifies the vessel as a short-range patrol combatant and
interdiction vessel. Traditionally, they have been used for convoy work and pirate interdiction, although they sometimes operate in
task forces or as border patrol vessels.

Design: The design for the Corvette is a simple, modular affair that was meant to be cheap, easy to produce and effortless to
maintain. The crew support systems and engineering spaces are enclosed in a small primary hull with twin nacelles trailing out and
down from the vessel. The craft is designed to break away from the pylons and eject the engineering spaces as a single unit in the
event of a core failure or other catastrophic event. Shed of the bulk of the engines the saucer section becomes little more than highly
maneuverable lifeboat.

Engineering: The FUWE-2 warp drive that was developed for the Cheyenne-class was found to be a perfect match for the Corvette.
The high output, low mass drive is capable of driving the Corvette at an impressive emergency top speed of warp 9.8, but it can only
sustain these speeds for 6 hours. This is due to the limited output of the Corvette’s small deflector array and her finite structural
support system, both of which are incapable of high power outputs for extended periods.

Tactical: The Corvette’s main asset is her fairly strong offensive weapons array. Her five FH-10 phasers cover the vessel from all
approach angles with her FP-10 torpedoes providing an impressive backup punch. Although a single Corvette operating alone is an
easy target, Corvette’s usually operate in groups of four or eight to maximize their firepower. The FSQ shield system mounted aboard
ship is the most powerful small hull design fielded to date and is able to withstand a massive barrage of enemy fire.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The Corvette’s small thirty-two man crew is fairly comfortable for such a small vessel. In fact,
the Corvette is the smallest vessel built with a holodeck, a valuable asset for a ship with such long patrol missions. The computer
system is a reengineered version of the type developed for the Bay-class DDE and is sufficient for the vessel’s needs.

Development and Construction History: Of the 270 Corvette-class cutters built to date, 222 remain in active service with 16 new
units built per year. Two are operating with Starfleet Training Command, one with Starfleet Intelligence, eight with the reserve fleet

   In the handful of years since they entered their evaluation period with Starfleet operations, the diminutive County-class destroyer
escort has earned a reputation as a fierce and competent combatant. That she will enter full-scale fleet deployment is now a foregone
conclusion, but the question of whether the County-class will completely replace the Bay-class DDE or simply supplement her is
anyone’s guess. By any standard the County is a far superior escort than the venerable Bay, but her greater cost and support
requirements may eventually be her undoing.

Classification: The County-class is geared toward escort and interdiction roles and has been designated as a destroyer escort.

Design: For any student of Starfleet history, it comes as no surprise that the design of the County-class is inspired by the long since
retired Locknar-class frigates. The spaceframe has been obviously updated however, and her saucer section has more in common with
the Bay-class than anything else. Otherwise, as one engineer put it, the resemblance to the Locknar is “a spooky though happy
coincidence.”

Engineering: Like the Bay-class that she is intended to replace, the County is made up of a number of swappable hull sections that
can be substituted with mission specific modules or for ease of repair. She also retains the Bay’s ability to separate from the nacelles
and warp core thanks to a series of hull separators along the ventral superstructure. Her FUWE-1 warp drive has been in service in
other classes for a number of years and is a perfect lightweight, high output choice for vessel’s of the County’s size. Her twin FIF-2
impulse drive nearly doubles the output from the Bay-class and provides phenomenal maneuverability.

Tactical: The County was designed around the inclusion of a quartet of FQ-1 quantum torpedo launchers. The fore aft arrangement
of this devastating weapon allows the County to aggressively close with the enemy, pound their hull with a flurry of torpedo fire and
zoom past to repeat the attack with the aft tubes. The FH-10 phaser array is a bit light when compared with other vessels of her size,
but they are mounted in a manner that allows for excellent coverage and a relatively high rate of fire.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: At nearly twice the size of the Bay but with only 75% of the crew requirements, the County is a
roomy vessel. Though she spends much of her time on short-range support missions or escort duties, the class sports holodecks and




                                                                  176

recreational facilities that would normally be considered outside her requirements. Both of these aspects of life aboard the County
have made them popular assignments. The County possesses a unique isolinear dual computer core arrangement, something usually
reserved for much larger vessels. In the event of catastrophic system failure or battle damage, the second core can be removed from
protected mode and brought on-line in a matter of minutes. In the rare event that the County is called upon to perform stellar
observations or tactical surveillance, the second core can also be brought on-line for parallel processing and information storage.

Development and Construction History: The County was developed by Starfleet Tactical of San Francisco and was recently
approved for full-scale production at a rate of six vessels per year after a three-year evaluation period. Of the eight ships of the class
to enter service, all remain in active deployment.

   In the early part of the 24th century, small escort vessels were replaced by larger multimission cruisers that were more capable than
their smaller counterparts but more difficult to construct. By the late 2350s Starfleet was seriously in need of new escorts to take up
where the heavier vessels left off. One of the first designs to come out of the development project was the Saber-class escort, a small,
swift, over-gunned vessel and light scout ship. While similar vessels like the Defiant-class or Sequoia are more oriented toward
offensive missions, the Saber has proven herself time and again as a capable defensive asset and intelligence gathering platform.

Classification: Although she is designated as an escort, the Saber performs numerous other duties for the fleet.

Design: Considering her mission scope, the Saber is a fairly simplistic design with a small saucer section and twin nacelles trailing
out from the side of the vessel. The aft engineering bay houses the drive units and small deflector array while the cramped primary
hull houses the crew and weapons systems.

Engineering: Primary propulsion for the Saber is provided by a reengineered version of the FUWA-2 warp drive with a top speed of
9.89 for up to twelve hours. The FIG-2 impulse drives provide impressive maneuvering and auxiliary power for such a small vessel
and is widely touted as one of the Saber’s best design features. Although she is slightly larger than the Defiant and carries the same
crew compliment, the Saber uses the extra space to incorporate larger fuel bunkers and storage lockers to facilitate long range scouting
missions, something her contemporaries are only moderately suited for.

Tactical: The weapons aboard the Saber are slightly less devastating than the type mounted aboard the much touted Defiant-class but
have a slightly better range of coverage. Her FH-15 phaser banks are able to fire a devastating volley into the forward arcs and flanks
of the vessel before recharging. The fore/aft mounted FP-10 torpedo launchers provide a close in backup strike with a duel capacity
for photon and quantum type torpedoes. Furthermore, her FSR-1 shield generator provides slightly better protection than the first
generation FSS-M series mounted aboard the Defiant. The Saber also incorporates several other tactical systems that remain classified
due to their sensitive nature.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: Like most vessels of her classification, the Saber is a crowded ship with most internal space
either taken up by machinery or storage. Due to her occasional long range patrol missions, Starfleet Engineering was able to shoehorn
in a few recreational facilities and a small holodeck, but life aboard ship is less than luxurious. The computer system aboard ship is
the same type developed for the Defiant-class and has been criticized for its limited storage capacity during the Saber’s intelligence
gathering mission.

Development and Construction History: Of the twenty-four Saber-class escorts built to date, twenty-one remain in active service.
Construction recently ended at the Makin County Ship Yards with the commissioning of the USS Skyhawk. It is expected that
sometime in the next five years that the licensing and plans for the Saber with be transferred to the Corillian States for use in their own
construction program.

Historical Notes:
           Voodoo     Destroyed by the Borg at the Battle of Typhon on stardate 4/7305.
           Broadsword Destroyed by forces of the Romulan Empire near the Neutral Zone on stardate 4/7406.
           Dragonfly  Destroyed by the Borg at the Battle of Typhon on stardate 4/7305.

While her crew was enjoying shore leave on Risa on stardate 4/7610.11, the USS Waraxe was docked at the small Starfleet facility
above the resort planet. It was there that a team of anti-Starfleet Risian peace activists boarded the vessel posing as a repair team and
went about sabotaging her primary systems as a form of protest. With most of the ship’s crew on the planet and the shipboard security
systems disabled the Risians ran amuck aboard the Waraxe for more than an hour and managed the vandalize over 70% of her key
systems. Order was restored only after a boarding team was beamed aboard the Waraxe from the USS Christopher Pike II, another
Starfleet vessel that had just arrived in orbit. The five demonstrators were taken into custody with no casualties and the Waraxe was
towed to a repair dock at Utopia Planitia for an extensive refit.

On stardate 4/7503.14, the USS Laconia was patrolling the Cardassian border when she was jumped by three Jem’hadar fighters.
Badly outmatched, the Laconia ran for a nearby asteroid field and attempted to use the debris to obviate the enemy’s sensors. While
negotiating a particularly thick parch of asteroids, the vessel’s helmsman brushed the side of the Laconia against an asteroid which
ripped her port nacelle, shuttle bay and part of the aft superstructure from the vessel’s hull. Although badly damaged, the Laconia
continued deeper into the field. Operating with only partial sensors the Jem’hadar only saw an explosion and debris where the
Laconia was which suggested the Federation vessel’s demise. In reality the Starfleet vessel was in bad shape but a long way from
dead in space. With her warp drive destroyed and communications limited to intership, the Laconia‘s captain resigned the vessel to
hiding in the field until help could arrive. Meanwhile, the Dominion propaganda began spreading word of the Laconia’s demise
confirming Starfleet’s fears that the vessel had been destroyed. The fact that she had failed to report in for over two weeks only
strengthened the Dominion’s claims. When the war ended nearly a year later, Starfleet began an effort of salvaging destroyed vessels
and retrieve bodies for burial, and the lost Laconia was near the top of their list. Instead of a burnt out hulk they found the vessel on
minimal power still hiding in the asteroid field with her crew alive and well. The badly damaged vessel was taken back to starbase for
repair and her crew were all awarded commendations in light of their ordeal.

   The Sequoia-class escort project began as a parallel design project with the emerging Defiant/Pathfinder project in 2366 as a
response to the Borg threat. The philosophy behind both designs was a small and easy to produce warships integrated with the most
firepower the designers could squeeze into their hulls. It is one of the great ironies of history that the Defiant-class was canceled after
problems with the prototype cropped up and Starfleet went with the Sequoia as their production design. Reports of the time sited her
as easier to produce and more cost effective than the more battle oriented Defiant. In just a few years Starfleet Engineering was no
longer producing the Sequoia-class and the Defiant as the backbone of the fleet during its conflict with the Dominion between 2373
and 2376. Although she looks phenomenal on paper, the Sequoia just proved to be too complex, too short ranged and not versatile
enough to meet the fleet’s needs.

Classification: The Sequoia is classified as a short-range escort.

Design: The Sequoia is designed around an ellipsoid shaped saucer section for a narrower target profile and a small secondary hull
that houses the vessel’s engineering spaces and fuel tanks. Twin nacelles are hung close to the secondary hull to give them maximum
protection from incoming weapons fire. Unfortunately, her designers chose to build a traditional bridge module instead of the
recessed type that proved to be so invaluable aboard the Defiant-class.

Engineering: One of the Sequoia’s strengths lies in her advanced propulsion system. The FUWE-3 warp drive is barely small
enough for inclusion on the Sequoia and provides an impressive top speed of warp 9.85 for 12 hours or a cruising speed of warp 6.5.
Her twin FIG-1 impulse reactors with gimbaled exhaust ports literally hurl the Sequoia about the battlefield at sublight speeds making
her a difficult target to hit.

Tactical: The FH-16 phaser array found aboard the Sequoia is the same type pioneered by the Akira-class and provides the ship with
the equivalent firepower greater than some light cruisers. Her torpedo array is a purely offensive affair with twin FP-10 launchers
mounted forward and a fixed quantum launcher providing a devastating follow up punch. Although her FSS-M shield system was
standard for the time, it has proven itself unsuitable of late and upgrades are planned for the class’ 20 year refit cycle.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: Life aboard a Sequoia-class escort is a lean one with only the barest of support systems in place.
The only officers aboard ship with their own staterooms are the Captain and XO with the rest of the officer corps and crewmen living
two or four to a berth. The medical facilities are rudimentary at best with provisions for a single doctor, no nursing staff and only an
EMH for backup. Recreational facilities are equally nonexistent leaving the crew little to do between shifts. Fortunately, the
Sequoia’s cruising range is very limited and the vessel spends most of her time in port. While this does not eliminate the boredom, it
does provide relief between the infrequent long patrol mission. Her computer system is the same isolinear type developed for the
Defiant and is able for the vessel’s needs.

Development and Construction History: Construction of the class ended in 2373 after full construction contracts for the Defiant-
class were approved in early 2370. The planned 40 vessels of the Sequoia-class wound up as five completed vessels and one hull
scrapped at 20% into construction. Of the five vessels commissioned, all remain in active service.

   By the late 2320's, Starfleet had been turning itself almost completely away from its military role to focus on diplomatic and
exploration issues. Larger multimission starships were the wave of the future, meaning that one vessel could be expected to do the
work that five vessels performed just thirty years before. As a result, the fleet's ability to respond in force in a military situation was
limited and to do so stripped valuable vessels from other assignments. While the newer large vessels were capable starships, they
were entering conflicts at a substantial numerical disadvantage. The solution for the time was the Shepard-class escort.

Classification: The Shepard-class is designated as an escort.

Design: Whereas past escort type vessels had been built for short range convoy duty and local area support, the Shepard was
designed to be an integral part of task force operations. An escort's traditional roll was to be a highly maneuverable fire support
platform clearing a path for larger vessels. To fit into it's new role, the small hull design would need to emphasize cruising range,
which meant less habitable internal volume in favor of fuel and weapons storage. The Shepard sports a light yet structurally sound
saucer section with a small stardrive directly aft. The twin nacelles sweep gracefully above the hull and are reinforced with armored
baffles to deflect incoming weapons fire. The design is small, utilitarian, and one of the most aesthetically pleasing in Starfleet
history.



                                                                   184

Engineering: The twin nacelles on the topside of the saucer section contain a fairly unique engine arrangement. Instead of one
nacelle containing one set of driver coils, they contain two, a system that allows the vessel to travel at high speeds for long periods of
time. Although she has a top speed of only warp 9.3, the Shepard is able to sustain that speed for over 36 hours, three times longer
than most other front line starships. Her small FIF-1 impulse reactors provide sufficient speeds at sublight velocities, but manage only
adequate auxiliary power.

Tactical: The Shepard mounts a fairly powerful punch for such a small ship and is perfectly suited for fire support missions. The
triple FH-14a phaser cannon is nearly identical to the type used aboard the Renown-class and is backed up by four longer ranged FH-
10 arrays. The FP-4 torpedo launcher mounted in the fore section was devastating during the Shepard’s heyday but is quickly
becoming outdated. The same can be said for the FSS-3 shield system. The Shepard was one of the first classes to be fit with the
penta-transducing shield generator making the vessel’s specifications a closely held secret for several years. Upon commissioning, the
units fit on the Shepard and Grissom were prototypes and the only two in existence aside from the evaluation system aboard the test
ship Discovery. The heavier shield system meant that the small vessel could withstand incoming fire much longer than any previous
starship. This would allow the ships under her protection an extra measure of support that previous escorts could not provide.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: To fit into it's new role of task force support vessel and long range tactical escort, the small hull
design would need to emphasize cruising range which meant less habitable internal volume in favor of fuel and weapons storage. This
necessitated the development of several innovations to automate the ship’s primary functions, allowing for lower crew requirements
and support systems. The computer system used aboard ship is a standard isolinear type that is adequate for the vessel’s needs.

Development and Construction History: Along with the Fletcher-class destroyers, the Shepards formed the backbone of the fleet
screening forces during the Tholian and Cardassian conflicts. Although the design is somewhat dated by modern standards, the
Shepard is an integral part of Starfleet to this day, and upgrades are planned for the near future. Of the 37 Shepard-class escorts
constructed, 22 remain in service. Most of these were built at Sol System and 40 Eridani shipyards. The vessels of this class are
named in honor of the Terran astronauts of the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs of the latter twentieth century.

Alamo-class Defense Outpost




   The Alamo-class defense outpost entered service in 2262 as a way for the fleet to provide fixed defensive assets for high value or
vulnerable systems near enemy lines. Since then, these space borne fortresses have served as a first line of contact against those who
would wish to cause harm to Federation interests. Constant upgrades made possible by the Alamo’s flexible design have kept them
state of the art tactical platforms and a source of pride for the crews that serve aboard them.

Classification: The Alamo is classified as a defense outpost, a designation that notes her static nature and role as a defensive asset.

Design: The Alamo has changed little over the last fifty years and is a familiar sight for anyone who has traveled to the border regions
of the Federation. The upper command complex contains the crew support facilities, labs, offices, computer core, communications
array and sensor suite. The next cluster of structures contain the crew and visitors quarters, promenade, commercial space recreational
areas of the ship. Space for these sections here gradually doubled by adding two new promenade hubs in the 2320s and 2330s. Below
that is the engineering section, which houses the generators, fuel tanks, workshops, shuttlebays and the bulk of the facility’s defensive
weaponry and shield generators.

Engineering: Power generation for the Alamo has been constantly improved over the years to provide for the ever-increasing
demands of the outpost’s defensive systems. The addition of a pair of auxiliary impulse generators along with the habitation level
refits did little to help increase the facilities maneuverability, but did serve to increase power reserves markedly.

Tactical: The very reason for the Alamo’s existence is to provide local control of the surrounding space and protect nearby
Federation assets. The outposts are usually positioned singly or with a pair of Gatekeeper defensive platforms that are remotely
operated by teams from the Alamo. After for itself, the Alamo can call upon a bewildering array or weaponry to force back any
determined enemy assault, and recent upgrades over the last twenty years have kept them at the cutting edge of Starfeet tactical
technology. Her primary offensive weapon is a collimated strip of FH-15 phasers taken directly from the Galaxy-class starship. This
is in addition to her banked FH-11 array which by themselves provides the comparable firepower of a large cruiser along all three
approach vectors. To top it all off are three FP-10 torpedo launchers with the ability to lay down a volley of twelve warheads
simultaneously. Her FSX-4 shield generators are made possible only by the endless reserves of power provided by the facility’s
massive anti-matter generator and backup fusion reactors. Taken all together, the Alamo possesses an equivalent of firepower and
protection far greater than any active line warship in any fleet.

Crew Support: In addition to serving as defensive assets and mini-starbases, the Alamos also attract a wide variety of commercial
and civilian traffic and are natural transportation hubs. The promenade decks are open to anyone wishing to use the facility and
available space in the engineering section’s cargo areas can be leased by anyone with a need for the accommodations. The crews
enjoy spacious quarters alongside the station’s civilian population and commingle with their counterparts freely. The types of
recreational facilities aboard the station vary widely from Alamo to Alamo and depend on the entrepreneurial spirit of those who have
chosen to set up businesses there.

Development and Construction History: Of the 405 Alamo-class defense outposts constructed to date, 376 remain in active service.
Production continues on an as needed basis, though of late this has averaged at a rate of one or two units per year.

I-Continent-class Assault Ship




   It has been said on more than one occasion that the I-Continent-class assault ship is an ugly vessel with an ugly mission. She is
designed to slog her way through enemy lines and land Marines in hostile environments, nothing more, nothing else. To this end, the
I-Continent is perfectly suited for the task, and has served for decades with Starfleet’s Military Operations Command.
   Fortunately, the class’ mission scope is so narrow that they are rarely needed for their designed purpose, and between conflicts they
spend most of their time at the starship storage depot at Memory Beta. While there, the vessels are defueled, fluid lines are drained,
and non-critical areas are vented to space. Specially trained civilian contractors maintain the ships on a monthly basis and keep these
behemoths in such a state of readiness that from the time the order is given, most of the I-Continents can be back in full service within
28 days. In addition to the mothballed fleet of I-Continents, the Starfleet Reserve keeps six of the ships on active status in order to
respond quickly in a crisis situation.

Classification: The I-Continent is classified as an assault ship, denoting her role as a troop carrier and landing support vessel.

Design: The I-Continent is an improved version of the older Continent-class of the last 22nd century. The new version follows the
same general arrangement of the original class, though it has been scaled up approximately 30% across the board. The outboard
“wing” sections of the hull provide an even greater measure of protection for the engineering section’s vital areas and feature a new
internal “blast baffle” design to direct and minimalize incoming weapon strikes.

Engineering: This version of the Continent is powered by the capable FIWG-1 warp drive, a type that has been in service for decades
with the fleet. As deployed aboard the I-Continent, this drive features several maintenance aids that allow it to be kept in a dormant
state for months or years at a time and be brought back on line with little user intervention. This was done to decrease the amount of
time needed to get these ships back on the line and reduce the maintenance workload of the civilian contractors assigned to her
upkeep. In the field, the FIWG-1 provides a standard cruising speed of warp 6 with an emergency threshold of warp 9 for up to 12
hours. Her twin FIF-1 impulse drives provide decent maneuverability at sub-light speeds for an auxiliary vessel.

Tactical: Like most auxiliary vessels, the I-Continent carries little in the way of armament and relies on escorting vessels to provide
the firepower needed to reach her target. The FH-10 arrays that the ship does carry are purely defensive, though they are sometimes
called upon for light fire support work for ground forces. Her FSQ-1 shield system is almost completely obsolete by modern
standards, and if the class is ever pulled back to Utopia Planitia for upgrades this system will be at the top of the project manager’s
list. Otherwise, the vessel’s 4200 man Marine contingent is well equipped to perform the planetary assault mission the I-Continent
was designed for. Her massive storage bays contain the assault tanks, artillery, munitions, combat transporters and drop ships
necessary to get an entire brigade on the ground and fighting in less than an hour.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The mission scope and deployment cycle of the I-Continent does not necessitate the inclusion of
many crew amenities. While under way, the crew is housed in barracks style units on decks two and three while the marines are
berthed in barracks spread throughout the rest of the primary hull. In general, while the vessel is in a deployment zone, the troops are
to be kept in ground based bivouac areas and will embark aboard the vessel when absolutely necessary. The I-Continent simply lacks
the facilities necessary to maintain troops aboard ship for extended periods of time.
   In keeping with the rudimentary nature of the I-Continent, the computer system aboard the vessel is a stripped down isolinear type
developed initially for the Shepard-class escorts. With little need for long-range sensors or mass data storage, the model in use is
ample for the vessel’s engineering and navigational needs.

Development and Construction History: Of the 50 I-Continent-class vessels built between 2334 and 2350, 38 remain in ready
reserve status at Memory Beta and six are in active reserve with Starfleet Military Operations Command.

   Lessons learned in the Tholian conflict and other armed encounters convinced Starfleet planners that a single purpose command
and control vessel was needed to organize the movements of the fleet. This vessel would incorporate the communications and
command facilities of a starbase but have the benefit of a mobile platform to work from. This would allow mission planners to view
the situation on site whereas in the past they relied on reports from their field commanders for accurate and sometimes outdated
information. In early 2341 a call went out to product a limited of these vessels under the name Project Cygnus, the beginning of the
Cygnus-class command courier.

Classification: Although she mounts the armament of a medium cruiser, the Cygnus is classified as a command courier, a designation
that denotes the vessel as a mobile field command center.

Design: For simplicity sake, the Cygnus is designed around the saucer section and power distribution system of the proven
Ambassador-class starship. The nacelles are merely attached to the underside of the primary hull with most of the vessel’s
engineering spaces and equipment taking up the aft section of the saucer sensor housings.

Engineering: The FIWA-1 warp drive that was built into the Cygnus is a proven and easy to maintain design capable of driving the
vessel up to warp 9.2, Modifications in the early 2370 increased that speed to a more impressive 9.5 for twelve hours or a cruising
speed of warp 6.2. Her impulse drive arrangement is a single FIG-3 that provides sufficient maneuvering power at sublight speeds.

Tactical: On a first glance the Cygnus is a well armed vessel. However, her weapons array is meant to be used purely for defense and
she is unable to stand up well in a fight. However, a series of refits in the early 2370s improved her topredo launchers to the FP-10
standards for increased counterbattery protection. In a fight the Cygnus is expected to withdraw to a safe position with escorts or
leave the scene completely. Vessel commanders are under orders to not engage the enemy directly as the Cygnus’ are too valuable as
front line command posts to be risked in direct conflict.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The normal crew compliment aboard these ships are fairly small allowing for fairly comfortable
crew quarters and recreational facilities. When in use as a mobile command base the Cygnus’ can expect to take on an additional 75-
150 passengers to round out her command/administrative facilities. These ships will also usually act as the center of a field base, so
the Cygnus is further fit with extensive machine shops and shore facilities for visiting crewmen on stand down. Her computer systems
are of the same type developed for the Ambassador-class with a second unit acting as the secure communication and intelligence
distribution hub for vessels in the vicinity.

Development and Construction History: Of the five Cygnus-class vessels built, four remain in active service. When not actively on
field maneuvers the vessels of the class can usually be found permanently fixed to various starbases until needed.

Historical Notes:
           Northampton      Destroyed by Cardassian infiltrators while on maneuvers near Starbase 375 on stardate 4/5601.

On stardate 4/5601.17, the USS Northampton was performing fleet level training exercises near the Cardassian border as a show of
force against their aggressive neighbor. The Cardassians wished to send a clear message that any actions would be met by the most
violent means possible and set out to prove it. Using a fast but hard to detect raider, the Cardassian infiltrators used their vessel to
sneak past the fleet’s picket ships and match course with the Northampton. Upon beaming aboard the ship the saboteurs were easily
located, but surprise was on their side and they had ample time to plant demolition charges on the vessel’s anti-matter supply. Their
raid soon changed into a suicide attack when Northampton’s crew disabled the Cardassian’s transporter system. Fortunately, the
Cardassian’s raider vessel was only slightly damaged in the explosion, and Starfleet Intelligence was able to develop a counter to the
vessels low observeability technology within the year.

Gatekeeper-class Defense Platform




   The conflict with the Cardassian Union in the 2350s had taught Starfleet a number of costly lessons in defending static targets,
namely vulnerable colonies, deep space supply depots or fixed staging areas. Several enemy raids had completely overwhelmed what
defenses these targets had and let to their loss with the enemy go virtually unopposed. There were too many potential targets to assign
a starship to the protection of each site, and Alamo-class defense outposts constituted an enormous outlay of manpower, material, and
logistical support. What’s more, the Alamos inhabited fixed orbits with predictable patterns of coverage and were nearly impossible
to reposition in an emergency. In the end, Starfleet came up with a compromise, and by the early 2360s were deploying the first
Gatekeeper-class defense platforms.

Classification: The Gatekeeper’s primary role is fixed asset protection and local battlefield interdiction and is classified as a defense
platform. It differs from the traditional defense outpost as it carries no crew and is controlled from a ground base or other facility.

Design: The upper structural segments of the Gatekeeper and the communications sail are a redesign version of the Alamo-class’ with
numerous changes to the layout and power distribution system. The slender secondary hull contains a massive matter/anti-matter
power generator tipped with a conical deuterium tank and long-range tactical sensor array. To the sides of the Gatekeeper are sets of
secondary solar generators that provide power during minimal load periods, but these assemblies serve a secondary purpose. Once the
anti-matter core is brought on-line these panels can be drawn in and arrayed about the central core to provide a layer of “armor” to
these vital systems.

Engineering: The FMAGJ-1 matter/anti-matter power generator is a militarized version of a type developed for civilian use over a
decade before. The addition of a set of Starfleet spec safety interlocks and ruggedized anti-shock mounts were all that was needed to
bring his dependable unit up to code. The Gatekeeper also employs a trio of custom-built FIPF-2 impulse drives that allow the
platform a measure of maneuverability, limited though it may be. The omission of an onboard crew allows the Gatekeeper to operate
beyond normal flight tolerances, a feature that her remote crews have used to their advantage on more than one occasion.

Tactical: The heart of the Gatekeeper is an impressive collimated array of FH-11 phaser banks with no less than three supporting FP-
10 torpedo launchers. These systems put together equal and in some cases exceed the output of some cruisers and provides their
charges with a degree of security that was impossible to achieve beforehand. Her shield systems are able to draw on a nearly
bottomless reserve of power and provide outstanding protection to the Gatekeeper.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The Gatekeeper was designed form the outset to be self-sustaining and makes no provisions for
an on site crew. Instead, the central computer core is tasked with the automation of several of her primary systems, while a crew of as
few as three can command the platform from a remote location. Usually this will be a hardened ground command post with a
dedicated and redundant comm uplink. Theoretically, and with the correct access codes, one could command the Gatekeeper with a
PADD while walking down the corridor of a starship two sectors away, an amazing feat of engineering and technical prowess.
Aboard the platform though, a small provision has been made for crew accommodations for use during the occasional on site
maintenance cycles. For crew safety, an older shuttlecraft, usually a type 4 or 5, is kept in a small garage on level 8 for emergency
use. The computer processing power of the Gatekeepers is surprisingly robust and it needs to be considering the demands placed on
the system. In addition to running the targeting sensors, maintenance protocols and uplink command translators, the computers
usually handle a large amount of sector subspace communications traffic for civilian or military use.

Development and Construction History: Of the 1680 Gatekeeper-class defense platforms built to date, 1488 remain in active
service. Production is usually handled on site by the Starfleet Corps of Engineers, though the major assemblies are fabricated at a
number of facilities throughout the Federation and towed to their final destination by a fleet of dedicated tugs.

   After the conflict with the Cardassian in the 2350s, Starfleet was facing a serious shortage of available light scout craft. The
protracted conflict had kept the aging fleet of Argus-class scouts in almost constant operation observing not only the volatile war zone
but also the always-unstable Romulan Neutral Zone. Repairs and upgrades went ignored and the Argus' suffered greatly. After the
Borg invasion of 2367, Starfleet needed their venerable scouts more than ever, but the reality was that the starships were at the end of
their service life. In early 2367, the design for the Heimdall-class scout was approved as the successor to the Argus.

Classification: The Heimdall was designed from the keel up as not only a military early warning craft, but as a vessel of exploration,
and has earned the designation of scout.

Design: The Heimdall follows the traditional twin nacelle, secondary/primary hull arrangement familiar to most Federation starships.
The hull is studded with sensor clusters and easily swappable pallet sections that can be mounted in the notched fore and aft sections.
The vessel was created around the warp field dynamics modeling and general layout of the successful Shepard-class escorts while
retaining the best internal features of the venerable Argus-class.

Engineering: The FUWE-1 warp drive fit aboard the Heimdall was chosen for its superb acceleration curve and lightweight
construction. When used aboard the Heimdall, it allows the vessel to achieve high warp speeds much quicker than other starships
making a fast getaway possible. Her top speed of warp 9.75 for eighteen hours or a cruising speed of warp 6.5 makes the Heimdall
one of the fastest vessels in the Federation fleet and a valuable part of the modern heavy task force.




                                                                 196

Tactical: In a combat situation, the role of a scout is to make contact with the enemy, determine their strength and intentions and then
disengage before shots can be exchanged. To perform this mission, the Heimdall’s weapons array is purely defensive, and is not built
for extended brawls with capital ships. When operating with a task force, the Heimdall is usually the first to engage the enemy and the
first to withdraw, leaving the more powerful vessels to the attack. The Heimdall is too valuable to risk in direct conflict with enemy
forces, and will fall back to an observation point to protect her task force's flanks.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: The Heimdall’s mission scope necessitates the inclusion of numerous mission specialists and
technicians making the vessels of the class fairly crowded. However, since the vessel can expect to be away from port for months at a
time on research missions or border patrols, she is provisioned with the most modern recreational facilities the fleet has to offer. The
computer system is the all bio-neural makeup pioneered for the Intrepid-class and is well suited for the Heimdall’s role.

Development and Construction History: The Heimdall-class scout was produced at a rate of three per year at numerous sites
throughout the Federation. Of the 30 vessels of the class built, 22 remain in active service. Seven were lost in the line of duty and one
was sold to a private research interest. Construction concluded in 2379 at the Utopia Planitia Fleet Yards on Mars with the
commissioning of the USS Monolith.

The Dominion made numerous forays into Federation space during the war between 2374 and 2376, but several of their attacks have
been hushed up or conveniently forgotten for security reasons. Details of such attack have recently begun to surface, such as a
Jem’hadar attack against the Shar Ta’Kel shipyards above Vulcan on stardate 4/7408.13. The yard was in full production for the war
effort and was home for over thirty ships in varying states of construction or repairs. One of these was the USS Onami, a Heimdall-
class scout that had taken moderate damage to her warp drive in an attack by Cardassian forces. While laid up in drydock, she along
with the Fletcher-class USS Killen and Spitfire-class USS Cobra, were boarded by Jem’hadar troops that had come into the facility on
a disguised civilian freighter. Moving under cloak, the Jem’hadar troops managed to set charges aboard the three vessels then moved
to the repair facility to take advantage of the mayhem to come. When the Onami and the other vessels were blown from their moors
and disintegrated in a ball of flame, the Jem’hadar troops began to fire into the confused crowds on onlookers. It was two hours
before the last infiltrator was brought down by Starfleet Security and order returned to the facility. The total losses in the raid were
the three vessels, their associated drydocks and refit bays with over 433 Starfleet and civilian workers killed. After the incident,
security was increased threefold at all spaceyards throughout the Federation. This had the effect of drawing off assets from the front
lines, an action that was probably what the Jem’hadar wanted in the first place.

The Battle of DS-13 on stardate 4/7906 signaled the Federations reentry into its third major conflict in three years. Alerted to the
Romulan presence along the Neutral Zone, Starfleet is able to muster only a handful of defenders against the Romulan’s 14 Warbirds.
The station defenders consisted of only the starships Heracles, Blackwell, Kirov, Royal Oak, Fuso and three Gatekeeper defense
platforms. The initial Romulan barrage destroys the Gatekeepers, leaving only the starships and the stations defenses. The Warbirds
then began to attack the starships, and in most cases a hopeless 2:1 dogfight was the result. The Romulans were merciless, and while
no less than eight Romulan vessels pounded on the station itself, the remaining Warbirds tracked down and slaughtered the crippled
Starfleet vessels. Only the scout ship Thresher was able to evade the Romulan forces, but was picked off hours later by the warship
Devoras. With the station shields collapsed and Romulans beginning to board, the station commander ordered a self destruct, bringing
an abrupt end to the Battle of DS-13. When the smoke had settled, the Federation had lost six starships and a fully functional
observation post. The Romulans lost only a Hathos-class cruiser and suffered minor damage to three Warbirds. Before the day is out,
two more Starfleet vessels in the Triangle will be lost, the USS Valhalla and the Heimdall-class Chiyoda.

   The Galaxy-class starship was first introduced in the late 2350s as a replacement for the venerable Oberth-class research cruiser as
the primary instrument of Starfleet exploration. However, by the mid-2360s it was becoming increasingly obvious that the Galaxy
was needed more for the defense of the Federation and her primary mission of exploration was progressively more of a sideline
activity. Several losses of operational Galaxy-class vessels early in their careers greatly reduced the fleet’s ability to field these
behemoths and replacement units were slow in coming. In 2365, initial design work was already under way for the Pathfinder
Development Project, an effort to introduce a new escort-class vessel with the firepower and durability to counter the Borg. Several
promising computer models were studied and the project would eventually lead to the Defiant-class, an altogether excellent vessel that
has served the Federation well over the last decade. Of the designs developed by the project, number NXP-2365WP/T was culled to
act as the basis for Starfleet’s newest fleet surveyor, a medium range vessel to serve in Starfleet’s research efforts for the next eighty
years.

Classification: The Nova is classified as a research cruiser or surveyor. This indicates that the Nova can operate, map and inspect a
region of space for later follow up by more capable explorer type vessels should anything of interest be discovered. The Nova also has
a limited scouting and surveillance capability for use along sensitive border regions. The Mk II Nova introduced in 2385 is more
oriented toward the scouting role with better speed and range.

Design: The Nova’s overall design closely follows the original Pathfinder template with minor revisions to her forward long-range
sensor array and the addition of a backup navigational deflector in place of two forward torpedo launchers. The blended hull design is




                                                                  199

similar to the Intrepid-class and serves to increase structural integrity and durability. Twin nacelles trail out along the top of the vessel
in a manner familiar to most Federation starships.

Engineering: The propulsion suite aboard the Nova was built for durability instead of speed, and the hardy FUWA-1 warp drive was
chosen for the class. Easy to maintain in the field and one of the most fuel-efficient units in the fleet, the type was an logical choice
for the Nova’s builders. Her twin FIF-3 impulse drives are equally durable and provide impressive maneuverability at sublight speeds.
The Mk II redesign of the class introduced the employment of the FIUWA-1 warp drive, a marked improvement over the old system
that gives her a top work speed of warp 9.7. For the first time in her deployment history, the Nova is able to perform the scouting
missions she was designed for without the fear of being overrun by faster enemy vessels.

Tactical: When a vessel is designed as a surveyor, the armament is usually a secondary consideration. However, several holdovers
from the Pathfinder design phase allowed the inclusion of an impressive weapons suite for such a small vessel. The newly fielded
FH-16 phaser array allows the Nova to engage threat vessels at range where she will be a more difficult target for return fire. Her
three FP-10 torpedo launchers were left over from the Pathfinder’s original eight and provide an ample secondary strike along with the
directed energy weapons. The Nova’s FSS-M shield array is of a type normally found on larger vessels and is essential considering
her sometimes perilous survey missions and occasional exposure to threat forces sometimes twice her strength. The Mk II Nova
employs the more powerful FQ-1 quantum torpedo, a weapon that has the ability to make any aggressor take the diminutive scout
seriously as a threat.

Crew Support/Computer Systems: As she was designed for long-range survey missions, the crew enjoys roomy quarters and
excellent recreational facilities. Most vessels of the class have been retrofit over the years with one or two small holodecks, an
obvious oversight during her initial fielding. The computer suite aboard ship is impressive and consists of a hybrid bio-
neural/isolinear makeup.

Development and Construction History: Of the eighteen Nova-class vessels constructed, thirteen remain in active service.
Although construction was suspended in 2381, building resumed in 2383 after a design review and upgrade of the class to new
specifications. Refits are not planned for the existing class vessels and they will continue to act in the exploratory role. The Mk II
will supplement the Heimdall-class scouts which have seen the end of their production run.

Historical Notes:
              Nova        Destroyed after being forced to crash land on Ceti Draconi II during a plasma storm on stardate 4/6907.
              Equinox     Reported lost, presumed destroyed while on a survey misson near Bajor Sector on stardate 4/7002. Found in
                          the Delta Quadrant on stardate 4/7506 by USS Voyager and destroyed shortly thereafter in a conflict with an
                          unknown alien species.
              Noble       Destroyed while scouting a Cardassian staging position near Bajor on stardate 4/7408.
              Tarus       Reported lost, presumed destroyed while scouting enemy positions in the Carlsbad System on stardate
                          4/8011. Debris later found on stardate 4/8109 confirming the vessels destruction.
              Portia      Scrapped after taking extensive damage from RFS forces while delivering supplies to an emergency aid
                          station near Corillia Prime on stardate 4/7807.
              Mir         Reported lost, presumed destroyed while en-route to Starbase 94 on stardate 4/8203.
