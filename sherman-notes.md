# Sherman Class 

As expected from a largely automated ship class, 
the Sherman is an aging design. This design, however, was constructed with 
her eventual obsolescence in mind. As a automated freighter, the
Sherman can perform routine, mundane missions
under her own programming, or be directed by
an 'escort ship' via subspace link for hazardous duties.

Starfleet maintains a small number of these
freighters in active duty, largely to service and
supply outposts and starbases. The bulk of the ships
of this type are under civilian arrangements or
slated as reserves. The single phaser bank found on
the Starfleet version of the ship is not available on
the civilian version, and is disabled for any automated use. 
Though the age of the Sherman's actual design is
now well over, the class will likely continue to see
service for decades to come, though increasingly in
ëautomated onlyí roles. Surprisingly, however, a
new version of the ship is being considered for a
purely civilian design, based on declassified Federation technology.


## Editor's Annotations

The _Sherman_ class was shown in _The Star Trek: Animated Series_ episode 'More Tribbles, more Troubles'. 
Two of these vessels were shown, with
slightly different registries than shown here, and
were severely damaged by a Klingon Cruiser. The
Sherman class name comes both as a reference to
Sherman's Planet, referenced in the episode, and
also to the Peabody's Improbable History shorts
running on television at the time.

The Sherman was one of only three Starfleet ship
classes shown in the Original series era. The scale
of the ship is in some question, since various shots
had the ship either larger or smaller than the Enterprise. 
The assumption here is that itís a little bit
smaller, though still large enough to serve as a bulk
freighter as compared to the Enterpriseís role as a
heavy cruiser.

The ship also bears some distinction in that, despite being completely authorized by Gene Roddenberry at the time of Star Trek: The Animated
Series, it has since been classified as non-canon because the automated bridge module does not
match the bridge modules of official starships. This guide just assumes that the Automated-possible ships had a different design criteria in mind than the bulk of the fleet.

The lines here, from the top view, are a bit different than the appearance as shown on the series. 
This is largely because the lines don't match up
all that well in the various shots, and the more
prevalent side view was given precedence. The
corrections made were done to bring the design
more in line with the rest of the fleet.

The NAR ships, or auxiliary reserves, are named
after various American freighters in modern history. The general freight ships, those with the
'NGL' registries, are named after Spanish freighters.
