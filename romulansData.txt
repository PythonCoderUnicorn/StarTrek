The Pyre-class battlecruiser came about as an attempt to improve upon the Battlehawk-
class and incorporate several advances that had entered fleet service in the proceeding
years.     At only 70% the mass of the original Battlehawk, the Pyre is slightly more
maneuverable and sports more robust shields and torpedo systems. However, no
amount of reworking the original flawed design could earn the Pyre the modicum of
respect it deserved, and it is an unpopular assignment. 
The future of the class may go hand in hand with that of the Battlehawk as a decision
will be rendered soon whether to retire, mothball or refit the Pyre fleet. Many believe that
the class will at the very least be retained in a reserve status as many are barely 20 years
old and in superb condition.
Of the 45 Pyre-class battlecruisers produced, 34 remain in active service. 5 have been
destroyed, three have been scrapped, one serves in the training command and the
remaining two have defected to the Romulan Free States. Production of the class ended some time in the early 2360s.

Unlike the Klingon L-24 class or Federation Excelsior-class of the late 2290s, the Z-1 Nova
class never enjoyed the extensive series of refits that kept her rivals an integral part of the
respective fleets for so long. Intelligence reports show that the Romulans had abandoned
upgrading their fleet of Novas by 2325 and retired most of the class by 2340. However, losses
during the Dominion War necessitated the recalling of many vessels of the class from mothballs
and twenty Novas went back into service. Fortunately for their crews, the Romulans had the
good sense to keep them far from the front lines and none were lost in the course of the war.
Instead, Novas were used to beef up internal lines and patrol non-critical border regions.
On paper, the Nova sports a fairly impressive array of tactical and defensive systems. In
reality, her computer, sensor and communications systems are of an antiquated design and are
increasingly becoming more of a hindrance than an asset. Although the class is rated for
emergency warp speeds of warp 9 and a cruising speed of warp 6, in reality they are barely
capable of warp 7.5 and 5.5 respectively. Alloy damage from long term exposure to a variety of
contaminants with no provision for systems swapouts have made the Nova’s almost dangerous
to operate, and it is thought that at least one has suffered a warp core breach due to these
neglected repairs. In any case, it will not be long before the Nova’s are placed back in storage
for another day. 
Of the 44 Nova-class battlecruisers built, only 16 remain in active service. 14 have been
destroyed, 6 have been scrapped, two are listed as lost, presumed destroyed, and six have
defected to the Romulan Free States. Production is believed to have ended some time after 2311

The Warhawk-class battlecruiser is a fairly typical battlecruiser type developed in the early 2360s as a 
supplement to the emerging D’Deridex type Warbirds. Functionally and tactically, 
the two ships have a lot in common, though the larger Warbird sports a more robust power plant and 
higher sustainable rate of fire. The Warhawk is not without its fans though, and features an 
impressive communications suite and capability for coordinating fleet movements in her
extensive CIC facility. On the battlefield, the Warhawks were a favorite target for 
Dominion raiders seeking to sew confusion among her enemies’ ranks. It took several 
losses before the Romulans learned to protect their fleet command assets effectively 
against these tactics. By this time though, fleet command duties were being passed to the
larger Kamarak type Warbirds, and production of the class was brought to an abrupt halt. 
Of the 33 Warhawk-class battlecruisers built, 17 remain in active service. 
15 have been destroyed and one was scrapped. Production of the class ended in 2374.

She is maintenance intensive, short ranged, awkwardly gunned and thoroughly
unpopular among her crews. In short, the Deathstorm is the pariah of the Romulan fleet.
In actuality, the ship is well suited for offensive operations is and a valuable fleet asset
that is all too often under utilized due to her poor reputation.
When the class was developed in the early 2360s, the Deathstorm was built around a
mixed missile weapon suite of a heavy plasma torpedoes and standard photon torpedo
launchers. When operating with a pair of Mandukar-class destroyers, the Deathstorm
presents a serious threat that can cut a swath through most enemy formations with
deadly ease. When she is placed on the defensive, the Deathstorm has a hard time
fending for itself without extensive fleet support. Fortunately for the class though, her
“wing” structures provide almost total cover for her warp nacelles from most angles, and
when pressed the Deathstorms have an uncanny ability to fleet the field to return at a
time and place more to their liking.
The c lass underwent one modest revision in the early 2370s that saw an upgrade to
her photon torpedo and shield systems. By the time the Dominion War began, all vessels
of the class had either been refit to the new standard or were custom built to the Mk II
specifications. 
Of the 30 Deathstorm-class heavy cruisers built, 19 remain in active service. 6 have
been destroyed, three were scrapped, and two have defected to the Romulan Free
States. Production ended in 2374.

As a tactical asset geared toward taking the fight to the enemy, the Rath-class 
attack cruiser has few peers in any of the Alpha Quadrant fleets. No other vessel 
of comparable size is able to match the Raths raw firepower or ability to consistently 
deal out massive amounts of damage. Unfortunately for the Romulans, building only a 
handful of these marvelous vessels nearly bankrupted their fleet procurement process.  
The Rath is roughly twice the size of a Klingon B’rell-class scout, but devotes much 
more space to crew accommodations and fuel storage. Her rapid fire RPL-4 plasma 
torpedo array is unique to the class and occupies a pair of wing mounted exterior 
pods near the dorsal wing roots. During the Dominion War, the Raths were used as 
raiding vessels who acted in pairs against Dominion depots deep in enemy space. 
Acting in concert, the duo would swoop into an enemy base, decloak and unleash a 
withering volley of plasma weaponry. With the enemy thrown into chaos, the Raths 
would either recloak and move on to the next target of opportunity or lurk nearby 
until vulnerable rescue units moved into the area. Of the 8 Rath-class attack cruisers built, 
6 remain in active service. One was destroyed, while the other, the Rehan, was 
listed as lost, presumed destroyed after encountering an unclassified spacial rift near the Klingon Border.

The Algeron-class cruiser’s design is clearly inspired by a fusion of the Pyre and Warbird-class vessels, 
and greatly expands on the capabilities of both of those vessel types. At barely half the length of a Warbird,
the Algeron is still an imposing vessel with a good blend of offensive firepower and defensive staying power. 
Her shields are of a slightly less efficient type that what is in general use at this time, but are sufficient 
for the class’ needs. In the field, the Algeron makes a fine surveyor and explorer, an aspect of vessel 
design that the Romulan fleet has let fall by the wayside in recent years. At the very least, 
the Algeron is one of the longest ranged vessels in their fleet and sports a number of special machine shops 
capable of turning out parts that can keep the Algeron’s on the go for years at a time. While engaged in 
combat operations, these facilities can become invaluable to other vessels seeking her service in an 
attempt to press home the fight without wasting time in a drydock. In an effort to exploit her 
exploration capability, the Algeron sports a unique docking system that allows a Vastam-class scout to 
attach to the underside of the mothership between the warp nacelles. In this manner, on a long mission 
Vastam crews can enjoy the facilities of the Algeron, refuel and perform maintenance. On the flip side, 
the parent vessel can utilize the Vastam as an advance scout in unexplored regions or send her into 
areas where she would dare not go. Of the 24 Algeron-class cruisers built to date, 18 are in active 
service. Six have been destroyed in the line of duty. Production of the Algeron continues 
at a rate of two new vessels per year

Part science vessel and part fleet cruiser, the Avian has amassed a respectable  
operational record since it was introduced into service. Avian crews paid a terrific
price during the Dominion War and were often used as a screening command ship with two or 
three Mandukar’s at the point of a main body of Warbirds. They were often singled out for
destruction by the Cardassians because of their reputation of dishing out a healthy rate of 
disruptor fire. As science vessels, the Avians typically operate with one or two Vastam-class 
scouts as a mini task force in unexplored space. In this role they have been modestly successful 
and are one of the longer ranged vessels in the Romulan inventory. For any Romulan officer looking 
to expand his experience in the science fields, there are few better assignments than an Avian. 
Of the 40 Avian-class cruisers built, 18 remain in active service. 19 have been destroyed, two 
have been scrapped and one is listed as missing, presumed destroyed.The class is notable for the 
unique paint schemes that the yard workers apply to the “bird” pattern on each vessel’s dorsal hull. 
These colorful works of art are a point of pride for Avian crews and a contributing 
factor to the high morale that these ships enjoy.

It not quite clear when the Battlehawk-class cruiser first entered the Romulan Fleet inventory, but it is easy to say
that the design has nearly exceeded is usefulness as a fleet asset. Her shields are woefully underpowered in the face
of modern firepower and her ability to provide serious weapons fire is modest at best. For sure, the Battlehawks are
sturdy vessels and are useful in a number of fleet support roles, but their time is quickly coming to a close. Even
upgrading the class as a whole has been deemed unfeasible, and I the next ten years half of the existing vessels will
most likely be reverted to mothball status or scrapped. The remaining vessels may either serve out their operational
lifespan or be relegated to reserve status.
Obviously, the class was the inspiration behind the Warbird-class, though the
Battlehawk is barely half the size of that impressive class. Nonetheless, the two are often
confused on long range scans, and the Romulans have used this in the past to mask fleet
movements against Starfleet along the Neutral Zone or the Dominion during that conflict.
In this, it can be said, the Battlehawks still provide a modest service to the Empire.
Of the 90 Battlehawk-class cruiser constructed to date, 44 remain in active service. 
23 have been destroyed, six are listed as missing, presumed destroyed, seven have been
scrapped and 10 have defected to the Romulan Free States. Construction of the class
ended sometime in the early 2350s.

The Hathos-class cruiser was a modest attempt to improve upon the disappointing 
Pyre-class and give the fleet a supplementary cruiser while the new generation of
D’deridex-class warbirds came on line. In this role the Hathos can be said to be slightly
more successful than her predecessor, but only slightly so. The Hathos has the
advantage of a modern torpedo type and decent disruptors, but on the whole lacks the
power or rate of fire to be a truly devastating weapons platform. It is difficult to find any
other praise for a class that can barely stand against Starfleet’s second line starships.
However, the Hathos is simple to build and maintain and does have its supporters within the Empire.
In 2377 the whole class was pulled from service for a period of three months after the
warship Klaskar mysteriously blew up while on a high warp run from Corellia Prime to
Romulus. A detailed analysis of her warp core assembly revealed serious manufacturing
defects that necessitated the scrapping of three other vessels of the class. The Klaskar
and the three other ships had been built together at the same yard nine years previously
and received defective parts from the same supplier.
Of the 50 Hathos-class cruisers built, 35 remain in active service. Seven have been
destroyed, 4 have been scrapped, and 4 have defected to the Romulan Free States.
Production of the class ended in 2372 after a short ten-year production run.

One of the more Combat  22 Person-scout type vessels successful in service today is the  
Romulan Vastam-class, a multi-role design that has served the fleet for over
two decades. This diminutive ship is by no means as combat oriented as
the Klingon B’rell or as sophisticated as the Federation Heimdall, but the
Vastam has proven that she can hold her own both on the battlefield and in the most far flung regions of the galaxy.
When developing the Vastam, the Romulans had one demand, and that
was speed. They wanted a vessel that could run rings around any other ship
at sublight velocities and blaze a path at high warp for weeks or even
140  months at a time. They were successful in this and were able to do so
without sacrificing her tactical systems or information gathering abilities.
To be sure, the vessels are cramped for long durations scouts, but the crews
enjoy the high morale and camaraderie that comes from knowing that they are a valued part of the fleet.
As an offensive asset, the Vastam is a capable opponent, especially
against similarly sized vessels or even older cruisers. However, few fleet
commanders would ever squander the Vastam in this risky manner as they
are perfectly suited for closing with the enemy to gather a wealth of sensor
information. Once this is accomplished, they disengage back to friendly
lines confident that the enemy will be unable to keep up.
When acting as a vessel of exploration, the Vastam has the ability to
operate independently if necessary, but their real forte is in cooperating
with other larger science oriented vessels to act as an advanced scout. They
serve to find the best routes, develop itineraries for their larger charges and
perform surveys of items of secondary importance. It is a system that the
Romulans have down to a science is the envy of many fleets throughout the
Alpha Quadrant. A minor variant of the Vastam omits the topside torpedo
launcher in favor of a latching system that allows the scout to dock with an
Algeron-class cruiser. In this parasite mode, the pair makes use of the
facilities of each other and help extend their exploration capabilities.
Of the 120 Vastam-class scouts that have entered service, 94 remain in
active service. nine have been destroyed, three have been scrapped, six are
listed as lost, presumed destroyed and six have defected to the Romulan
Free States. Production continues at a reduced rate of 2 per year.
