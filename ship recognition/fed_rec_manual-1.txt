INTRODUCTION

  Welcome to the first in a series of Ship Recognition Manuals—the first of many
to come, hopefully, given the vast number of ships populating the universe of
Star Trek and the vast interest so many gamers have in them.
   As the title indicates, this book uses the advanced starship construction and combat
rules provided in Last Unicorn’s book Spacedock. You won’t find any new rules or
the like in this book, but it describes all the ships with the Spacedock rules. Without
Spacedock, you’ll find that a lot of the technology described on the various Starship
Templates doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to you.
   This volume concentrates primarily on the vessels of Starfleet. From the Akira-class
Heavy Cruiser to the Zodiac-class Cruiser, you’ll find plenty of options to choose from
when deciding what type of ship your characters live on in your series, which ships to
include in a Starfleet attack squadron for a Dominion War scenario, or what kind of ship
the Crew will see when they respond to that distress call they just received.
   However, this book isn’t entirely devoted to Starfleet vessels; there’s a handful of
commonly encountered allied and Threat species vessels as well, such as the Jem’Hadar
Attack Ship or D’deridex-class warbird. Narrators who can’t find a particular vessel
they’re looking for in this book can simply adapt one of the ships presented, or use the
Spacedock rules to create it on their own.

Where the two pylons meet between the
spars there’s a large “control tower” which
oversees the return of fighters (and protects
them with its torpedo launchers). The control
tower contains the ship’s warp engine and battle
bridge.

        DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
           Fleet data: The Bradbury-class is a Heavy
        Frigate designed for missions in or near high-
        threat regions of space (such as near the Romulan
        Neutral Zone or any system fought over in the
        Dominion War). It combines strong shields with
        a powerful weapons array and a high degree of
        speed and maneuverability to create a potent
        offensive platform.
           Physically, the Bradbury consists of a
        separable arrowhead-shaped saucer section,
        an Engineering section with a roughly trapezoi-
        dal cross-section, and two downward-curving

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
   Fleet data: The Centaur-class Cruiser, like
the Curry-class or Yeager-class, is a product of
the desperation created by the threat of the
Dominion and war with it. In order to field
as many vessels as possible to counter the
Dominion’s military incursion into the Alpha
Quadrant, Starfleet had to construct many ves-
sels quickly, without the full complement of
systems and capabilities possessed by most of
its ships. The Centaur is the perfect example.
It consists of a modified Excelsior-class saucer
to which is attached two warp nacelles via two
short pylons and a small “engineering module”
at the aft of the saucer. To make it a powerful
combatant, it’s equipped with nine phaser arrays
and two torpedo launchers. Although it has
no separation system, it has a second impulse
system to back up the first and provide extra
Power.
   The Centaur-class has no reason for existence
beyond combat. It lacks the advanced systems
and storage capabilities necessary for explora-
tion or long-term patrols, or the facilities neces-
sary for diplomatic missions. However, it defi-
nitely helped to bolster the often all too weak
Federation lines in the Dominion War.

   Noteworthy       vessels/service     records/
encounters:    U.S.S. Centaur, prototype con-
structed in 2373; U.S.S. Chiron, participated in
Operation Return (2374).

        DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
            Fleet data: The Challenger-class Light Cruiser
        is a design of rather lengthy lineage. Based in part
        on the original U.S.S. Challenger, NCC-2032,
        it consists of little more than a saucer adapted
        from the Galaxy-class Explorer program, with
        two warp nacelles attached to the aft part of
        the saucer with a T-shaped pylon so that they
        sit above and behind the saucer itself. (Some
 SS     variants of this class situate one nacelle above

 LO     the saucer, one below.) The resulting ship, while
        not aesthetically pleasing, and underpowered
 NG     compared to most Light Cruisers despite a
        series of upgrades, serves well as a patrol ship,
        short-range exploration and scouting vessel, and
        diplomatic courier.

           Noteworthy      vessels/service  records/
        encounters:     U.S.S. Armstrong, NCC-57537,
        attacked by Klingon assault group (2373);
        U.S.S. Buran, NCC-57580, destroyed by the
        Borg at Wolf 359 (2367). Also in service:
        U.S.S. Kearsage, NCC-57566.

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
   Fleet data: The Cheyenne-class is the Heaviest
of the Light Cruisers; in fact, it’s nearly as
long as a full Cruiser, and it’s armed with
a respectable complement of Type IX phasers
and photon torpedo launchers. It consists of
a large saucer with a notch aft, to which is
attached a small Engineering section. Attached
to the Engineering section are four pylons—two
curving gently downward, two gently upward—
terminating in warp nacelles.
   The Cheyenne-class serves primarily as an
escort and patrol vessel. With its speed and
offensive power, it’s well-suited to dealing
with aggressors or other problems. During the
Dominion War, Cheyenne-class vessels were
usually tasked as support vessels for larger craft.
They acted as the secondary anchors of fighting
wings, or sometimes even led smaller wings.

     DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
        Fleet data:     The Chimera-class vessel is,
     according to most Starfleet officers, the strang-
SS   est-looking of the jury-rigged ships built to fight

LO   the Dominion War. Attached to its Excelsior-
     style saucer section are three warp nacelles (two
NG   below, one above). Its weaponry, like that of
     its sister ship the Centaur-class Cruiser, also
     derives from the Excelsior-class ship; it includes
     multiple small phaser arrays located on both
     sides of the saucer, and a single array aft.
        Because of its unusual construction, the
     Chimera-class features relatively strong SIF, IDF,
     and shields to hold it together. Despite this, it
     has proven vulnerable to hull stress in many dif-
     ferent forms; Flight Control officers have learned
     to handle it with a delicate touch. (In game
     terms, if the ship attempts any maneuver with
     a Difficulty of 8 or higher and fails, it suffers
     2d6 x 10 points of damage against which only
89 ERthe SIF applies.)

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
   Fleet data: One of the oldest designs still
operational in Starfleet, the Constellation-class
Exploratory Cruiser derives from the Constitution-
class Explorer and Excelsior-class Exploratory
Cruiser. Taking advantage of Starfleet’s experi-
ence with those vessels, the ASDB designed
a ship with a Constitution-like saucer section
and four warp nacelles—two above and aft the
saucer, two below and aft—to exploit advances
in warp field theory. During the first few decades
of the 24th century, the Constellation class was
vital to Starfleet’s deep space exploration, colo-
ny support, and defensive patrol missions.
   The Constellation-class ceased production
twenty years ago. Starfleet expects to retire
those few vessels of the class which managed
to survive the Dominion War within the next
ten years.

   Noteworthy        vessels/service      records/
encounters:      U.S.S. Constellation, prototype;
U.S.S. Gettysburg, NCC-3890, former command
of Admiral Mark Jameson; U.S.S. Hathaway,
NCC-2593, participated in battle simulation
with U.S.S. Enterprise-D (2365); U.S.S. Magellan,
NCC-3069, commanded by Captain Conklin;
U.S.S. Stargazer, NCC-2893, former command
of Captain Jean–Luc Picard, presumed destroyed
in the Battle of Maxia (2355) but later recovered
by Starfleet (2364); U.S.S. Victory, NCC-9754,
commanded by Captain Zimbata, posting of
Geordi LaForge prior to his service aboard
the U.S.S. Enterprise–D. Also in service:
U.S.S.    Antietam,      U.S.S.    Fading     Sun,
U.S.S. Vespucci.

class ships under specified conditions. Because
the Defiant-class ship has such powerful engines
for its size, a cloak is not as effective as it might
otherwise be. It also emits chroniton particles
which can accumulate on the ship’s ablative
armor and, possibly, cause temporal accidents.
Additional ships of the class may or may not be
equipped with cloaking devices (ships without
cloaks subtract 29 SUs from their total used).
   The power of the Defiant’s engines (primarily
her Class 7/M warp drive) causes other prob-
lems. Although the ship can attain speeds in
excess of Warp 9, it will literally shake itself to
pieces at that velocity. For every tenth of a point
of warp speed over 9, up to 9.6, the ship takes
20 points of structural damage every round, and
for every tenth of a point of warp speed at 9.7
and above takes 50 points of structural damage
(only the SIF protects against this damage).
   The Defiant normally has a crew of 40.
However, sufficient space exists to triple its
bunks, allowing it to carry up to 192 persons.
   Although not intended to perform scientific
survey missions (most of its sensors are opti-
mized for military uses), the Defiant-class’s
sensors and other equipment are sufficient to
perform 82% of of the standard scientific sensor
sweeps. The ship typically carries Class I, III, V,                                                                             ALLO

            or when equipment and parts for a new starbase
            need to be taken to the construction site,
            Deneva-class ships are the ones to do the job.
               To maximize its efficiency, the Deneva-class
            does not have just a single configuration. Rather,
            the central part of its body is an open “frame”
            into which up to six Transport Modules can be
            placed. The modules hold up to 18 SU worth of
            supplies or facilities. Modules can be prepared
            for any mission, but some of the common types
            include:
               —Cargo: +200,000 cubic meters of storage
            space and shuttlebay for 6 SU worth of craft; or
            +600,000 cubic meters of storage space
               —Entertainment: +2 to Recreation rating, +2
            SU worth of quarters
               —Medical:     +3 to Medical rating, +3 SU
            worth of quarters
               —Personnel: +18 SU worth of quarters
               —Science:     Increase Science rating to 3,
            +200,000 cubic meters of storage space and
            shuttlebay for 2 SU worth of craft, +3 SU worth
            of quarters
               —Security: Increase Security to 4, +2 auxil-

        Built for a lengthy service life, the Galaxy-
     class contains numerous systems which can be
     replaced in toto at a spacedock facility. With
     a crew exceeding 1,000, it’s a virtual city in
     space, and carries many civilians in the form
     of crewmembers’ families. Its saucer section
     can separate from its Engineering hull to take
     the civilians away from dangerous situations if
     necessary.
        (Note: This template represents the uprated
     version of the Galaxy-class vessel in use as of
     2375. Earlier versions were more or less identi-
     cal, but had slightly less powerful warp drives
     and fewer upgraded systems. For the standard
     version, reduce its warp nacelles to Type 6D,
     and substitute the lower range figures for its
     photon torpedoes.)

reconnaissance. For most of the lifespan of the
class it has performed exploration missions in
which it enters new systems and sectors to
perform preliminary surveys prior to the arrival
of laboratory/research vessels and surveyors.
    The Hokule’a’s class designation comes from
its supposed resemblance to an old Earth vessel
called a catamaran. It consists of a central
Engineering hull which runs underneath a dorsal
saucer for about a third of its length, and half
the length of the saucer; the two are linked
by a short, wide connecting interhull which
melds with both saucer and Engineering hull in
a curvilinear fashion reminiscent of the much
younger Galaxy- or Intrepid-class ships. From
the port and starboard sides of the Engineering
hull, broad, thick pylons curve gently downward
to hold the warp nacelles. Along the apex of the
curve is a phaser array which thus has an arc of
fire greater than 360 degrees.

involve exploration and scientific experimenta-
tion, it possesses an extensive complement of
laboratories and scientific facilities. Each ship
has two laboratory slot which are particularly
advanced; Starfleet’s engineers decide which
labs to place in those slots (and thus which
scientific tasks the ship excels at) when building
each vessel. Most laboratories are on decks
seven and eight.
    The captain’s yacht attached to the Intrepid
is a special ship known as an “Aeroshuttle.”
Patterned in part after the Danube-class run-
about, it is slightly larger and more maneuver-
able than a typical yacht.
    Although not intended as a front-line combat
vessel, the Intrepid has powerful tactical sys-
tems. These include multiple Type X phaser
arrays and four high-yield torpedo launchers.
The ship ordinarily carries Type II and Type VI
torpedoes.
    Most intriguingly of all, the Intrepid has
atmospheric and planetfall capability—making
it the largest Starfleet vessel with those abilities.
When it lands, four large articulated “legs”
emerge from the ventral side of the engineering
hull to support it.
    Note: The Starship Template for the basic
Intrepid-class Light Explorer does not accurately
represent the U.S.S. Voyager in all respects, since
that ship’s crew has extensively modified her (in
part with Borg technology) during her time in the
Delta Quadrant. Some of the changes worked
on the Voyager include:          improved shields

        DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
           Fleet data: Designed 30 years ago to fill a
        perceived need for a ship which could conduct
        reconnaissance-, scouting-, and exploration-
        type missions in extremely dangerous areas, and
        secondarily could act as a courier for large
        groups of persons who needed to travel into
        or through such areas, the Istanbul-Class Fast
        Cruiser has performed that function admirably.
        Roomy for a Fast Cruiser, it can carry more
        personnel than most ships of its class.

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
    Fleet data:     Designed for long-term deep
survey missions, the Korolev-class Surveyor is
one of the largest and sturdiest science vessels
currently fielded by Starfleet. Named for a
famed 20 th century Earth space exploration
pioneer (whose name also graced a Miranda-
class vessel devoted to scientific purposes which
was decommissioned in 2314), the Korolev-class
ship typically undertakes multi-year deep space
missions to chart distant star systems, investigate
stellar anomalies, and generally advance the
Federation’s body of scientific knowledge.
    Starfleet continually uprates Korolev-class ves-
sels so that they have the most state of the
art sensor and science packages available. To
facilitate this process, many of its laboratories
and larger sensor arrays are modular. At a
spacedock, Starfleet engineers can easily tractor
one out and install a newer, better module in
its place.
    The main body of the Korolev is an Engineering
hull modeled after the type used on the
Ambassador-class Heavy Cruiser, but somewhat
more streamlined and elongated, with a round-
ed front end (where the navigational deflector is)
and a tapered aft end. The nacelles are held on
two short pylons which project slightly upward
at a slight forward angle. The Egineering hull
projects just a little bit forward of the short,
thick connecting interhull, which leads to an
ovate saucer section.

   Noteworthy       vessels/service     records/
encounters: U.S.S. Korolev, NX-59387, prototype
(not to be confused with earlier Miranda-class
vessel, NCC-2014); U.S.S. Goddard, NCC-59621,
participated in tachyon grid to prevent Romulan
interference in Klingon civil war (2368);
U.S.S. Gathev, NCC-61628, conducted explora-
tion of Gamma Quadrant (2371).

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
   Fleet Data: The Merced-class Light Escort
was developed in the first decade of this century
as part of Starfleet’s response to the Tomed
Incident. It was originally intended as a support
vessel for a proposed “Strike Cruiser” code-
named the Freedom-class. However, when the
Romulans chose to isolate themselves rather
than continue their historical pattern of aggres-
sion, the Freedom Development Project was
scrapped (though the class designation would
later be revived for a class of Frigates). Thus,
the Merced, which started production in 2312,
enjoys the curious distinction of having the
shortest production lifespan of any vessel in
Starfleet history (only four ships per year were
built over a four-year period).
   Despite their limited production life, Merced
vessels proved highly functional, and remain in
service today (albeit with many upgrades, and a
projected continued lifespan of only another 25
years or so, at most). Designed primarily for fleet
escort, troop transport, and interdiction duties,
they tend to have short ranges and capacities
(most missions last less than a year), making
them a somewhat uncomfortable “trial by fire”
for many brash young cadets. As of 2375, most
are attached to starbases, Deep Space stations,
and/or frontier fleets as support and defense
ships, or escorts for newer cruisers and frigates.
   The Merced-class has a saucer shaped like a
broad arrowhead with a single phaser bank on
the ventral side, much like the old Constitution-
class vessel. Its Engineering section is con-
tained in a “pod” attached to the ship by
an odd-looking, vaguely triangular Engineering
hull/connecting interhull.

   Noteworthy       vessels/service      records/
encounters:       U.S.S.    Merced,    prototype;
U.S.S. Trieste, NCC-37124, stationed near
Starbase 74, former assignment of Cmdr. Data.
Also in service: U.S.S. Calypso, U.S.S. Oberon.

       DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
           Fleet data: Taking advantage of knowledge
       and experience gained from creating the Istanbul-
       class Fast Cruiser and the early work on the
       Galaxy-class Explorer, the Advanced Starship
       Design Bureau decided to create another Fast
       Cruiser to complement the Istanbul. They kept its
       unusual three-nacelle configuration, but reversed
       it. Two nacelles are above the saucer and aft,
       and one is directly ventral the Engineering hull
       (which was adapted from the Ambassador-class
       Explorer and allows the ship to carry more cargo
       than most Fast Cruisers, as well as a second
       impulse engine for extra power or emergency
       use). They christened their new creation the
       Niagara-class Fast Cruiser.
           Compared to the Istanbul-class, the Niagara-
       class is faster, but much less well-armed. It

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
   Fleet data: The third of the Perimeter Defense
Directive ships to launch, the Norway-class Fast
Frigate represents the epitome of Starfleet’s cur-
rent automation technology. Unlike most ships
of its size, which have 400-600 crewpersons, it
has less than 200 due to the extensive use of
automation and advanced systems on the ship.
Among other things, it boasts a bio-neural com-
puter network, advanced tactical and sensory
systems, an EMH, and a holocommunications
system. Its technological sophistication also
shows in its use of redundant backup systems;
for example, it has a fully functional auxiliary
control room and a primary backup navigational
computer as good as its standard models.
   Due to its powerful warp drive and impulse
systems, the Norway-class is a fast, highly maneu-
verable ship well suited to its usual perimeter
defense and patrol and threat response duties.

   Unlike most Starfleet vessels, the Olympic-
class does not have a saucer section. Instead,
it has a much larger sphere section, which
contains most of its hospital beds and research
laboratories. A large section on the ventral
side of the Engineering hull contains additional
research laboratories where experiments with
dangerous infectious agents can be performed
at minimal risk to the patients.
   Olympic-class vessels are built with a modu-
larity feature which allows Starfleet to customize
them for particular types of missions or crises.
By replacing some laboratories or other facilities
with other modules, the ship can be customized
for medical research, disaster relief, combat
surgery, epidemic response, evacuation/triage,
or general humanitarian aid.

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
    Fleet data: The Rigel-class Heavy Scout was
first commissioned in the early 24th century
as part of the Coreward Exploratory Directive                                                                                       74206
(2321), and as participants in that project have                                                                                    74656
                                                                                                                                    NX 01A
helped to expand the Federation’s frontiers
greatly and bring many new species into the
Federation. During the Dominion War many
of them were uprated with improved phasers
and shields and sent into Cardassian-Dominion
territory to bring back valuable intelligence. Not
all of them made it back, but those which did
always brought tactically valuable information
with them.
    Although its performance in the Dominion
War shows that it’s still quite capable of carrying
out its duties, the Rigel-class is beginning to
show its age a little. Starfleet has begun the long,
slow process of decommissioning the class, and
often turns the stripped-down ships over to the
Federation Merchant Marine for use as freighters
and traders.

     DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
         Fleet data: Another product of the Perimeter
     Defense Directive, the Saber-class Light Cruiser
     is only slightly larger than the Defiant-class
31   Heavy Escort, and in fact owes much of its design
     (including its internal warp nacelle design)
11   to the Defiant Development Project. Since it

00   lacks the traditional pylon configuration, its
     Engineering hull is smaller than on most ships
     of its type, and the ship has a smaller target
     profile. (On the other hand, a warp core breach
     will cause more damage to the ship than normal
     because of this arrangement; increase damage
     from a warp core breach by 20%.) Its size and
     correspondingly light armament also make it
     quick and easy to produce.
         Most Saber-class ships are assigned to hos-
     tile frontier patrol, combat support, and escort
     duties. Some ASDB officers have suggested that
     with the addition of ablative armor, heavier
     armament (including pulse phaser cannons),
     and stronger shields (plus correspondingly more
     powerful warp engines for the necessary Power),
     the Saber-class could become a powerful front-
     line fighting vessel. Starfleet Command is cur-
M    rently considering their proposal.

Q       Noteworthy        vessels/service      records/
     encounters:         U.S.S.    Saber,    prototype;
     U.S.S. Yeager, NCC-61947, defended Earth
     against the Borg (2373) (not to be confused
     with the Yeager class of vessels); U.S.S. Shepard,
     NCC-62079, assigned to perimeter action duties
     in Sol Sector (2373-74), destroyed in Breen attack
     on Earth (2375); U.S.S. Storta, NCC-69531, cur-
     rently assigned to deep frontier patrol (2376).
     Also in service: U.S.S. Lu’ghara, NCC-68749;
     U.S.S. Veldar, NCC-69846; U.S.S. LaRue,
     NCC-72315.

        are better, since they incorporate technology
        developed since the Galaxy-class was created
        (such as the EMH, which was installed as
        a class-wide upgrade in 2372). As a Heavy
        Cruiser, the Sequoia is more heavily armed
        than the Galaxy; while it doesn’t have quite
        as many phaser arrays, it has several more
        torpedo launchers, including its devastating for-
        ward triple array. As soon as possible, Starfleet
        Command intends to equip both the Akira-class
 SS     and Sequoia-class with quantum torpedoes.

          erful and technologically sophisticated starship     record established by the ships to bear her name
          ever created by Starfleet (except perhaps for the    previously.

             The Sovereign-class was designed following        U.S.S Enterprise-E, NCC-1701-E, prevented Borg

          defense aspects of its mission. A task force
          composed of personnel from the Office of
          Strategic Operations, the Theoretical Propulsion
          Group, Spaceframe Design, and the Tactical
          Operations Group labored for years in conjunc-
          tion with Starfleet Research and Development
          to create the technologies needed for a new,
          more powerful, group of ships. The results
          included the pulse phaser cannon, ablative
          hull armor, bio-neural computer systems, the
          quantum torpedo, and many new spaceframe
          designs. These systems were incorporated into
          the new ships of the Perimeter Defense Directive
          and, in many cases, into the Sovereign-class
          as well.
             Incorporating advances in spaceframe design

  CA      and ship mission conceptualization, the ASDB
          created a hull for the Sovereign-class which was
  MI      sleek and powerful, like an arrow shot into the
          wilds by an errant explorer or a dart aimed at
          the hearts of the Federation’s enemies. Working
          from the baseline of the Galaxy-class Explorer,
          they lengthened the frame while reducing its
          height, thus decreasing its profile to enemy
          attack. The saucer and Engineering hull merged
          into each other seamlessly, with no saucer
          separation feature since this ship would carry
          few, if any, civilian personnel. Rather than
          follow the lead of the Defiant-, Saber-, and
042 SA IN Steamrunner-classes, which draw the vulner-
 89 IN 20 able warp nacelles into the body of the ship,
MI6 TS 00 the Sovereign Design Group chose to employ
          a traditional nacelle pylon configuration to
          improve the ship’s warp profile.
             The Sovereign-class’s weaponry is similarly
          advanced. Its 12 phaser arrays incorporate new,
          experimental Type XII ship phaser emitters,
          making them the most powerful phasers ever
          mounted on a starship. Its three torpedo launch-
          ers fire the new quantum torpedoes.
             Following a successful launch of the testbed
          U.S.S. Sovereign in 2370, Starfleet began work
          on the first fully functional Sovereign-class ves-
          sel, the U.S.S. Enterprise-E. Two years later that
          ship launched under the command of Captain
          Jean-Luc Picard, and so far shows all signs of

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
    Fleet data: This vessel, unusually large for a
Frigate, particularly a Light Frigate, is considered
by many a predecessor of the Sovereign-class
Heavy Explorer. It incorporates, sometimes for
the first time in Starfleet history, many features
which were later adapted and improved upon
for the Sovereign-class ship. Examples include
its saucer (which, while based on designs from
the Galaxy-class development program, is some-
what more oval and elongated), the multiple
phaser strips around the saucer covering almost
all angles around the ship, and a relatively short
connecting interhull.
    The Springfield-class ship is designed for
missions where speed and power are essential.
Among its more common mission profiles are
patrol of relatively calm frontier regions, search
and rescue, escort, and support. While it is now
a bit dated, regular maintenance and routine

   Fleet data:     Influenced by the designers’
perceptions of Vulcan aesthetics, the Surak-class
Escort features an unusual design in which
the Engineering hull attaches directly to the
aft side of a relatively shallow saucer section,
giving the vehicle a dorsal profile resembling an
old-fashioned Earth keyhole. The warp nacelle
pylons are swept back; they attach to the dorsal
aft part of the Engineering hull and project
downwards, giving the vessel a fast, “sporty”
appearance.
   Ironically, the ASDB named this well-armed
Escort, designed to protect merchant caravans
and accompany larger vessels to war, after
a man of peace. In addition to phasers and
torpedoes mounted forward and on the pylons,
the vessel has an aft weapons pod containing
two torpedo launchers and a phaser array.
Compared to more modern Escorts, the Surak-
class sometimes seems lightly armed, and is
gradually being relegated to duty in less danger-
ous, more settled areas.

            DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
              Fleet data: The newest Scout produced by
          Starfleet, the Talon-class vessel incorporates a
          number of advances in starship design. Small
          enough to be carried aboard a capital ship in
          a shuttlebay, its streamlined shape allows it to
          enter and maneuver in atmospheres, and even to
          make planetfall; in or out of an atmosphere, it’s
          extremely maneuverable. It has powerful sen-
          sors for a ship of its size, allowing it to perform
          very long-range scouting missions. And with

    CA    its three phaser arrays and three microtorpedo
          launchers, it’s heavily enough armed to take on
    MI    many threats.
              The Talon class also represents Starfleet’s
          first use of fully embedded warp nacelles
          on a field vessel. Following the success of
          ships with partially-embedded nacelles, such as
          the Steamrunner- and Saber-classes, the ASDB
          decided to develop a vessel with its nacelles
          fully encased within the ship’s body. Starfleet
          continues to evaluate this technology, which
          it refers to as “encased” nacelles, and may
          introduce it into additional ships if the Talon
042 SA IN doesn’t reveal any problems.

       DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
          Fleet data:          The Yeager-class Light Cruiser
042 SA IN is another ship assembled from spare ship sec-
 89 IN 20 tions, salvaged ship parts, and ships-in-progress
MI6 TS 00 for purposes of fighting the Dominion War. It
       consists of the saucer section of an Intrepid-
       class ship, a body adapted from a Starfleet attack
       fighter, and two warp nacelles on downward-
       projecting pylons. While rather Frankensteinian
       in appearance, the combination seems to work
       reasonably well, though it requires an especially
       strong SIF.
          Since it’s relatively lightly armed, with Type
       VIII phasers and only a single torpedo launcher,
       the Yeager-class serves best as a transport, escort,
       and patrol vessel. Now that the Dominion War
       has ended, the class’s fate remains uncertain,
       since other, better-designed, vessels are avail-
       able to fulfill these functions.

powered than others. (Note: the listed SU cost
for the shuttle assumes the best system of any
of the types listed for the various models of
shuttlecraft; individual shuttles’ total SU costs
are less.)
   For logistical purposes, Starfleet organizes its
shuttlecraft into classes. Class 1 represents the
smallest, least well equipped versions, including
Types 1-5 and any shuttlepod. Class 2 includes
shuttles slightly better equipped than that, such
as Types 6-9. Class 3 shuttles are the largest,
best-equipped ones, including Types 10-14.
   This Starship Template can also be used to
represent the captains’ yachts carried by various
large starships, such as the U.S.S. Enterprise-D’s
Calypso and the U.S.S. Enterprise-E’s Cousteau.
Captains’ yachts tend to be slightly larger than
the largest shuttles, and are always more luxuri-
ously appointed.

            DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
               Fleet data: This Starship Template represents
            a typical large Borg cube (smaller cubes, 3
            kilometers on an edge, also exist). Its enormous
            Power generation systems, numerous powerful
            weapons, and strong shields make it capable
            of taking on dozens of Federation ships and
            destroying all of them. Narrators can adapt this
            Template for Borg spheres and other ships.
               Unlike most other species, the Borg man
            each and every weapon on one of their ships
            with one or more drones. Thus, they can fire
            multiple times at targets without incurring a
            multiple action penalty.

       DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
              Fleet data: The D’Kora-class Cruiser, com-
          monly referred to as a “Marauder” for its fre-
          quent use in various raiding missions by unscru-
          pulous captains, is the most common capital

  CA      vessel in the Ferengi fleets. Physically, it has a
          crescent moon-shaped Engineering hull (points
  MI      facing forward) with a triangular cross-section,
          from which a central “neck” extends outward to
          hold the bridge section.
              An unusual combination of warship and
          trading vessel, its resources include enormous
          amounts of cargo space for holding trade goods,
          strong tractor beams for recovering salvage, and
          powerful warp engines with embedded nacelles
          for quick escapes from dissatisfied customers.
          Its weapons are mainly plasma beam projectors,
          ranging from a single large one in the “upper
042 SA IN weapon deck” (amidships on the forward edge
 89 IN 20 of the Engineering hull), slightly smaller beam
MI6 TS 00 arrays on the forward tips of each “wing” of the
          Engineering hull, and even smaller projectors
          concealed behind panels on the dorsal side
          of the ship’s neck. It also has one torpedo
          launcher in the upper weapon deck. The plasma
          weapons are built for effective firing at longer
          than normal ranges, thus allowing the Ferengi
          to get in the first blow and cripple an opponent
          before he can fire back. Ferengi ships are also
          good at generating plasma bursts to disrupt a
          target ship’s Power generation capabilities (see
          Spacedock, page 147); the Narrator may wish
          to grant D’Kora crews a +1 Test Result bonus for
          that tactic to reflect this.

        cannot move. The B’rel mounts a single photon
        torpedo launcher on the forward ventral side of
        the command module. To maximize the B’rel’s
        offensive capacity, its commanders often fire
        the two disruptor cannons in tandem (i.e., as a
        Multifire attack). Its greatest tactical weakness is
        that all of its weapons face forward, with limited
        arcs of fire. It cannot fire at opponents behind
        it or to its side, it can only attack targets almost
        directly in front of it.
 SS        The B’rel has three flight modes: landing

 LO     (wings fully raised); flight (wings held at mid-
        point); and attack (wings fully descended).
 NG     However, these are only preferred operating
        modes, not technological limitations; the ship
        can attack, cruise, or enter an atmosphere in
        any mode.
           Most B’rel-class Light Warships have crews of
        about 12. However, in wartime or when conflict
        is expected, the “passengers” are actually fellow
        soldiers who function as additional crew, giving
        the vessel a complement of three dozen or
        more.


        B’REL VARIANTS
           The Klingons have created many different
89 ER   B’rel variants. The most common, the D-12
65 OO   class Bird of Prey, has an improved targeting
21 MS   system involving a periscope-like device which
02 IR
99 HC   descends in front of the captain’s chair. The cap-
        tain, looking through the scope, can obtain more
        accurate targeting locks (upgrade to a Class
        Gamma TA/T/TS for modern D-12s). However,
        necessary modifications to the cloaking device
        render its plasma coil defective. If the ship is hit
        with a low-level ionic pulse, the cloak automati-
        cally engages, leaving the vessel without shields
        (and thus completely vulnerable to attack) for
        two seconds.
           The dimensions listed for the B’rel represent
        an average length. Due to individual House
        preferences, resource availability, and other
        considerations, they can range in size from
        about 110 meters in length to about 175 meters.
        However, all should be considered Size 4 for
        game purposes.

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
    Fleet data: Built using the same plans as
the B’rel-class Light Warship, but to larger
dimensions, the K’Vort-class Warship (or Battle
Cruiser) serves prominently in the Imperial
Klingon Defense Forces and many House mili-
taries. While not as powerful or sophisticated as
the Vor’cha-class Heavy Warship, it is cheaper
to build and maintain, making it attractive to
many poorer Houses.
    Unlike the B’rel, the K’Vort-class vessel has
only two flight modes, “attack” and “flight”; it
lacks atmospheric capability, and so does not
need a “landing” mode. However it avoids one
of the B’rel’s chief weaknesses by placing two
disruptor cannons and one torpedo launcher aft.
Its disruptor cannons often fire in tandem (i.e.,
as a Multifire attack).
    The K’Vort’s primary crew numbers only
about 350. However, it is designed to serve as
a troop transport, and can carry about 1,200
more personnel if need be.
    The dimensions listed for the K’Vort represent
an average length. Due to individual House
preferences, resource availability, and other
considerations, they can range in size from
about 250 meters in length to close to 700
meters. However, all should be considered Size
7 for game purposes (unless the Narrator wants
to prepare separate templates for the larger

       DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
          Fleet data: As of 2375, the main fighting
       ship of the Imperial Klingon Defense Force and
       the most powerful Klingon Great Houses is the
       Vor’cha-class Heavy Warship. Like most Klingon
       ships, it features a design with a broad body
       and nacelle pylons and a bridge at the end of
       a “neck” region. It also includes a large sensor
       module and aft weapons array in its aft dorsal
       region.
          Like most Klingon ships, the Vor’cha ignores
       the amenities of comfortable living—warriors,
       after all, do not need comfort, which only make
       them soft!—in favor of more and better systems.
       Like any proper Klingon vessel, it’s heavily
       armed, with 18 disruptor arrays, a forward
       disruptor cannon, and three torpedo launchers.
       The forward cannon is contained in a detach-
       able module. When the ship needs to attain
       higher impulse speeds, it can eject this pod;

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
   Fleet data:       The D’deridex-class warbird,
a vessel whose very appearance strikes fear
into the heart of the enemies of the Romulan
Star Empire, is the primary capital ship of the
Romulan people (though not the largest; that dis-
tinction goes to the Vereleus-class Dreadnaught).
In fact, its large size may be a subtle psychologi-
cal tactic designed to intimidate existing and
potential opponents.
   While Starfleet typically encounters this ves-
sel in hostile situations (or when allied with
the Romulans against a mutual foe, as with
the recent Dominion War), it actually performs
many of the functions and duties of an Explorer.
Since their first appearance along the Romulan
Neutral Zone in 2364, the D’deridex-class has
been the most commonly encountered Romulan
starship.
