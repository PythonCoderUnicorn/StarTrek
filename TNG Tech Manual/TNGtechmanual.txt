SECTION 1 

USS Enterprise is the 5th starship with same name, a Galaxy Class vessel, largest and most powerful in Starfleet.

built at Starfleet Utopia Planeitia Yards, Mars 
NCC-1701D
not designed to land on a planet 
length is 2102 feet 
weight is 5 million metric tons

capacity for 1012 people 
duration without refuelling is 3 years 
mission: research & diplomacy

WARP DRIVE 

Warp engines use antimatter as fuel 

    warp speed 
        warp factor 1 speed of light 
        warp factor 6 is normal cruising speed (392 times the speed of light)
        warp factor 9.6 (1,909 times the speed of light)
        warp factor 9.9 (only for a few minutes)
        warp 10 is unattainable for all ships in the galaxy 

        [warp 9.9 is 50% faster than warp 9.5]

    dilithium crystals
        matter/antimatter reactor has dilithium chamber component, this chamber is set to the harmonics of the antimatter reaction 

        dilithium chamber enables the warp coils in the engines to generate the subspace field which makes warp speed possible

    power 
        matter/antimatter reactor inside the warp drive system 
        deuterium plasma (hydrogen) is joined together with anitmatter 

    antimatter
        electrical charge & spin is opposite to 'normal' matter 
        matter + anitmatter = energy { E = mc^2 }
        antimatter fuel is extremely volitile , store in special magnetic container pods 

    subspace 
        when travelling at warp speed, the ship is suspended in a 'bubble' of subspace 
        which allows ship to travel faster than light 

    refuelling
    supply of antimatter and deuterium for 3 years 
    refuelling happens at a starbase 
    antimatter pods can be loaded through Cargo bays {dangerous}

    Bussard Collector = the front of warp engine nacelles incorporate a set of powerful electromagnetic coils 
        ship travelling at high speeds these coils generate electromagnetic field 
        which collects stray atoms of interstellar hydrogen for use of fuel

    Quantum State Reversal Unit (spin reverser) or antimatter generator -
        which uses transporter based technology to dematerialize a quantity of hydrogen and 
        rematerialize it with reversed charge and spin => antimatter
        QSRU requires lots of energy from the fusion generators to make a small amount of antimatter

    feed in power from the warp core  when needing high amounts of energy








IMPULSE POWER

Impulse power is part of the propulsion system for less than light-travel 

power 
    the impulse drive is powered by a series of fusion reactors which are located just below the saucer section
    a set of high powered magnetic accelerator coils drives the reactor exhaust through a set of subspace field coils  
    which propels the ship up to 0.999 of lightspeed 

    a second set of impulse engines is located on the rim of the saucer section


fuel 
    impulse fusion reactors are fueled by frozen hydrogen = deuterium 

speed 
    normal max impulse speed is 1/4 speed of light

    "full impulse" , "point-two-five light", "quarter light speed"
    very slow speeds are expressed in terms of meters-per-second
