WARP DRIVE 

Warp engines use antimatter as fuel 

    warp speed 
        warp factor 1 speed of light 
        warp factor 6 is normal cruising speed (392 times the speed of light)
        warp factor 9.6 (1,909 times the speed of light)
        warp factor 9.9 (only for a few minutes)
        warp 10 is unattainable for all ships in the galaxy 

        [warp 9.9 is 50% faster than warp 9.5]

    dilithium crystals
        matter/antimatter reactor has dilithium chamber component, this chamber is set to the harmonics of the antimatter reaction 

        dilithium chamber enables the warp coils in the engines to generate the subspace field which makes warp speed possible

    power 
        matter/antimatter reactor inside the warp drive system 
        deuterium plasma (hydrogen) is joined together with anitmatter 

    antimatter
        electrical charge & spin is opposite to 'normal' matter 
        matter + anitmatter = energy { E = mc^2 }
        antimatter fuel is extremely volitile , store in special magnetic container pods 

    subspace 
        when travelling at warp speed, the ship is suspended in a 'bubble' of subspace 
        which allows ship to travel faster than light 

    refuelling
    supply of antimatter and deuterium for 3 years 
    refuelling happens at a starbase 
    antimatter pods can be loaded through Cargo bays {dangerous}

    Bussard Collector = the front of warp engine nacelles incorporate a set of powerful electromagnetic coils 
        ship travelling at high speeds these coils generate electromagnetic field 
        which collects stray atoms of interstellar hydrogen for use of fuel

    Quantum State Reversal Unit (spin reverser) or antimatter generator -
        which uses transporter based technology to dematerialize a quantity of hydrogen and 
        rematerialize it with reversed charge and spin => antimatter
        QSRU requires lots of energy from the fusion generators to make a small amount of antimatter

    feed in power from the warp core  when needing high amounts of energy








IMPULSE POWER

Impulse power is part of the propulsion system for less than light-travel 

power 
    the impulse drive is powered by a series of fusion reactors which are located just below the saucer section
    a set of high powered magnetic accelerator coils drives the reactor exhaust through a set of subspace field coils  
    which propels the ship up to 0.999 of lightspeed 

    a second set of impulse engines is located on the rim of the saucer section


fuel 
    impulse fusion reactors are fueled by frozen hydrogen = deuterium 

speed 
    normal max impulse speed is 1/4 speed of light

    "full impulse" , "point-two-five light", "quarter light speed"
    very slow speeds are expressed in terms of meters-per-second 












MAIN BRIDGE 

Command area = main bridge 
Conn & Ops = 2 foroward stations, ship flight & operations 
Tactical = weaponry, defense and internal security 
Aft station = special purpose consoles (Science, Mission Ops, Environment & Engineering)




TRANSPORTER 

Transporter converts matter into energy and reconverts it back into matter at another location 

limitations
    range is 40,000 kms (distance of ship to a planet surface standard orbit)
    can't be used while ship shields are operating or at warp drive 
    objects stored in computer memory have limited resolution {no living being reproduction}

replication technology 
    converting matter into energy and back again 
    food replictaors use computer memory to store patterns at the molecular resolution 

    transporting beings works at the quantum level resolution to reproduce their thought patterns and DNA, this data is not stored into memory 

other transporters 
    command saucer section Deck 6 (1)
    engineering Deck 14 (2)
    cargo bay (8)
    emergency evacuation, 1-way (6)

transporter biofilters
    built in safety mechanism which scans incoming person and automatically filters out known (programmed) hazardous bacteria and viruses

direct beaming 
    the ability to beam person to a location outside the transporter area, ultimately beaming the person twice and consumes twice the power 
    to be used in emergencies 







ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS : ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY

Synthetic gravity 
    a network of force field generators to create an artificial gravity field identifical to Earth's 

    generators employ a series of superconducting graviton field matrices located under each deck,
    the size of hockey pucks and can run even when power is cut off 


inertial damping field (IDF)
    a second set of forcefield generators to create a field which absorbs the inertial stress created when 
    the ship accelerates to high impulse speed or warp drive. These are needed to reduce the G-forces.

    IDF generators also create a structural integrity field which helps reinforce the 
    structure of the ship. The excessive inertia energy generated is recycled by the tractor beams 








TRACTOR BEAMS 

the equivalent of a grappling hook or towing line 
which is a ofcused beam of polarized gravitons which act as a linear forcefield to 
pull objects towards the ship 









SHUTTLECRAFT & SHUTTLEBAYS 

a number of small auxillary spacecraft for short range use when a transporter is not necessary 

personnel shuttle 
    use for transporting 6 people within a solar system 
    max speed is warp factor 1

cargo shuttle 
    variation on the personnel shuttle but no passenger accomodations 

shuttlepod 
    a small 2 person craft, the size of a Earth minivan vehicle 
    used for very short range transport and for extravehicular activity (inspecting ship exterior)
    no warp speed capability 

shuttlebay 
    Enterprise has 1 large main shuttle bay located at the top rear of the saucer section, Deck 4 
    2 smaller secondary shuttle bays (2 & 3) on Deck 13 located at the 'neck' of the ship 

shuttlecraft names 
    shuttlecarft #1 = Sakharov 
    shuttlepod #5 = El-Baz 
    shuttlepod #7 = Onizuka 
    shuttlepod #12 = Pike (destroyed)











WEAPONS & DEFENSE

Enterprise mission is exploration, science and diplomacy. The ship has weapons in case situations arise 

The crew is trained in cultural sociology, strategy and crisis analysis, plus the sensors and computers.

phasers 
    {phased array emitter}
    a particle beam projector which is the ship's primary offensive weapon 
    at max power the main phaser banks can disrupt the surfce of a planet 
    phaser beams travel at the speed of light and are ineffective at warp speed 
    max effective phaser range is 300,000 kms 

    frequencies 
        base emitter frequency or secondary modulation of a phaser beam
        which is used to disrupt a deflector shield 
        most common is random modulation 


photon torpedoes 

    an energy weapon which a small quantity of matter and antimatter are bound together 
    in a magnetic bottle and launched at warp speed at a target 

    can be used at warp speed as not limited by speed of light


torpedo launcher 
    2 torpedo launchers : 1 on front and 1 at rear of Engineering hull 
    normally launched in clusters, each independently targeted 


deflector shield 

    a series of energy forcefields which protect the ship from natural dangers and enemy attack 
    navigational deflector sweeps far ahead of the ship and pushes aside meteoroids and space dust which might pose a 
    hazard to the ship 

    transporters can't be used when shields are in use 
    the ship's computer can automatically activate the shields in a crisis before human reaction 

    deflector shield power
        expressed in terms of percentage of shields remaining 











BATTLE CONFIGURATION (SAUCER SEPARATION)

In combat situations the ship is capable of separating intow 2 spacecraft 
the saucer section most holds the crew and their families and the 
secondary battle section is used for defense 

when separated the command of the battle section is transferred to battle bridge 

battle section (Deck 8)
    lower half of the ship includes the hull and warp engines 
    capable of warp speeds 
    armed with 2 photon torpedo launchers , phaser banks and deflector shield generator
    
saucer section (primary hull) 
    not capable of warp speed
    has impulse engines , deflector shield, phaser banks 

    residual warp fields can take minutes to fully collapse so the primary hull 
    can coast for some distance before going to sublight speed
