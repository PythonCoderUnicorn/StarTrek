PRIMARY HULL (Saucer Section) = Decks 1 to 16 

SECONDARY HULL  = Decks 8 to 42







WARP DRIVE 

Warp engines use antimatter as fuel 

    warp speed 
        warp factor 1 speed of light 
        warp factor 6 is normal cruising speed (392 times the speed of light)
        warp factor 9.6 (1,909 times the speed of light)
        warp factor 9.9 (only for a few minutes)
        warp 10 is unattainable for all ships in the galaxy 

        [warp 9.9 is 50% faster than warp 9.5]

    dilithium crystals
        matter/antimatter reactor has dilithium chamber component, this chamber is set to the harmonics of the antimatter reaction 

        dilithium chamber enables the warp coils in the engines to generate the subspace field which makes warp speed possible

    power 
        matter/antimatter reactor inside the warp drive system 
        deuterium plasma (hydrogen) is joined together with anitmatter 

    antimatter
        electrical charge & spin is opposite to 'normal' matter 
        matter + anitmatter = energy { E = mc^2 }
        antimatter fuel is extremely volitile , store in special magnetic container pods 

    subspace 
        when travelling at warp speed, the ship is suspended in a 'bubble' of subspace 
        which allows ship to travel faster than light 

    refuelling
    supply of antimatter and deuterium for 3 years 
    refuelling happens at a starbase 
    antimatter pods can be loaded through Cargo bays {dangerous}

    Bussard Collector = the front of warp engine nacelles incorporate a set of powerful electromagnetic coils 
        ship travelling at high speeds these coils generate electromagnetic field 
        which collects stray atoms of interstellar hydrogen for use of fuel

    Quantum State Reversal Unit (spin reverser) or antimatter generator -
        which uses transporter based technology to dematerialize a quantity of hydrogen and 
        rematerialize it with reversed charge and spin => antimatter
        QSRU requires lots of energy from the fusion generators to make a small amount of antimatter

    feed in power from the warp core  when needing high amounts of energy








IMPULSE POWER

Impulse power is part of the propulsion system for less than light-travel 

power 
    the impulse drive is powered by a series of fusion reactors which are located just below the saucer section
    a set of high powered magnetic accelerator coils drives the reactor exhaust through a set of subspace field coils  
    which propels the ship up to 0.999 of lightspeed 

    a second set of impulse engines is located on the rim of the saucer section


fuel 
    impulse fusion reactors are fueled by frozen hydrogen = deuterium 

speed 
    normal max impulse speed is 1/4 speed of light

    "full impulse" , "point-two-five light", "quarter light speed"
    very slow speeds are expressed in terms of meters-per-second 












MAIN BRIDGE 

Command area = main bridge 
Conn & Ops = 2 foroward stations, ship flight & operations 
Tactical = weaponry, defense and internal security 
Aft station = special purpose consoles (Science, Mission Ops, Environment & Engineering)




TRANSPORTER 

Transporter converts matter into energy and reconverts it back into matter at another location 

limitations
    range is 40,000 kms (distance of ship to a planet surface standard orbit)
    can't be used while ship shields are operating or at warp drive 
    objects stored in computer memory have limited resolution {no living being reproduction}

replication technology 
    converting matter into energy and back again 
    food replictaors use computer memory to store patterns at the molecular resolution 

    transporting beings works at the quantum level resolution to reproduce their thought patterns and DNA, this data is not stored into memory 

other transporters 
    command saucer section Deck 6 (1)
    engineering Deck 14 (2)
    cargo bay (8)
    emergency evacuation, 1-way (6)

transporter biofilters
    built in safety mechanism which scans incoming person and automatically filters out known (programmed) hazardous bacteria and viruses

direct beaming 
    the ability to beam person to a location outside the transporter area, ultimately beaming the person twice and consumes twice the power 
    to be used in emergencies 







ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS : ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY

Synthetic gravity 
    a network of force field generators to create an artificial gravity field identifical to Earth's 

    generators employ a series of superconducting graviton field matrices located under each deck,
    the size of hockey pucks and can run even when power is cut off 


inertial damping field (IDF)
    a second set of forcefield generators to create a field which absorbs the inertial stress created when 
    the ship accelerates to high impulse speed or warp drive. These are needed to reduce the G-forces.

    IDF generators also create a structural integrity field which helps reinforce the 
    structure of the ship. The excessive inertia energy generated is recycled by the tractor beams 








TRACTOR BEAMS 

the equivalent of a grappling hook or towing line 
which is a ofcused beam of polarized gravitons which act as a linear forcefield to 
pull objects towards the ship 









SHUTTLECRAFT & SHUTTLEBAYS 

a number of small auxillary spacecraft for short range use when a transporter is not necessary 

personnel shuttle 
    use for transporting 6 people within a solar system 
    max speed is warp factor 1

cargo shuttle 
    variation on the personnel shuttle but no passenger accomodations 

shuttlepod 
    a small 2 person craft, the size of a Earth minivan vehicle 
    used for very short range transport and for extravehicular activity (inspecting ship exterior)
    no warp speed capability 

shuttlebay 
    Enterprise has 1 large main shuttle bay located at the top rear of the saucer section, Deck 4 
    2 smaller secondary shuttle bays (2 & 3) on Deck 13 located at the 'neck' of the ship 

shuttlecraft names 
    shuttlecarft #1 = Sakharov 
    shuttlepod #5 = El-Baz 
    shuttlepod #7 = Onizuka 
    shuttlepod #12 = Pike (destroyed)











WEAPONS & DEFENSE

Enterprise mission is exploration, science and diplomacy. The ship has weapons in case situations arise 

The crew is trained in cultural sociology, strategy and crisis analysis, plus the sensors and computers.

phasers 
    {phased array emitter}
    a particle beam projector which is the ship's primary offensive weapon 
    at max power the main phaser banks can disrupt the surfce of a planet 
    phaser beams travel at the speed of light and are ineffective at warp speed 
    max effective phaser range is 300,000 kms 

    frequencies 
        base emitter frequency or secondary modulation of a phaser beam
        which is used to disrupt a deflector shield 
        most common is random modulation 


photon torpedoes 

    an energy weapon which a small quantity of matter and antimatter are bound together 
    in a magnetic bottle and launched at warp speed at a target 

    can be used at warp speed as not limited by speed of light


torpedo launcher 
    2 torpedo launchers : 1 on front and 1 at rear of Engineering hull 
    normally launched in clusters, each independently targeted 


deflector shield 

    a series of energy forcefields which protect the ship from natural dangers and enemy attack 
    navigational deflector sweeps far ahead of the ship and pushes aside meteoroids and space dust which might pose a 
    hazard to the ship 

    transporters can't be used when shields are in use 
    the ship's computer can automatically activate the shields in a crisis before human reaction 

    deflector shield power
        expressed in terms of percentage of shields remaining 











BATTLE CONFIGURATION (SAUCER SEPARATION)

In combat situations the ship is capable of separating intow 2 spacecraft 
the saucer section most holds the crew and their families and the 
secondary battle section is used for defense 

when separated the command of the battle section is transferred to battle bridge 

battle section (Deck 8)
    lower half of the ship includes the hull and warp engines 
    capable of warp speeds 
    armed with 2 photon torpedo launchers , phaser banks and deflector shield generator
    
saucer section (primary hull) 
    not capable of warp speed
    has impulse engines , deflector shield, phaser banks 

    residual warp fields can take minutes to fully collapse so the primary hull 
    can coast for some distance before going to sublight speed 










TACTICAL ANALYSIS

the ship's sensors and computers are essential to defense and offensive capabilities 












HOLODECKS

a holographic environment simulator to be used for crew training, recreation and exercise 
recreation is with 100% fidelity of computer memory

location = Deck 11, holodecks 1 to 4 

how it works 
    2 main subsystems : 
        holographic imagery subsystem 
        matter conversion subsystem

    holographic imagery subsystem
        creates images of incredible realistic background environments
        computer holographic projectors also control a series of shaped-field forcebeam projectors
        which are capable of physical substance to these images 

    matter conversion subsystem
        using transporter based technology this system creates physical 'props' and 'set dressing' from 
        raw material, ideally making it indistinguishable from reality 


animated characters 
    animated characters are composed of solid matter created by transporter based 
    replictaors and manipulated by articulated computerized tractor beams 
    which results in a realistic 'puppet' which look and behave almost exactly like living beings 


reality of objects 
    objects created in the holodeck can't leave the holodeck, even if they separated from physical reality due to 
    the focused forcebeam imagery 
    objects created by transporter matter conversion do have physical reality and can be removed from the holodeck 
    and could potentially lose ability to control them via computer 


personal holodecks 
    smaller personal holodecks are rooms the size of a treadmill
    it works like the large scale ones 











COMPUTER SYSTEM 

A massive library computer system which is used for everything on the ship 
Every control panel on the ship is a computer terminal and can respond to voice commands and keypad input

iso-linear optical chips 
    information storage medium of the ship's computer system 

    small rectangle of iso-chromatic linear memory crystal incorporates 
    a large amount of information storage and processing power and placed 
    in chip panel racks 

operating system 
    main library computers employ optical (not electronic processing) 
    LCARS  = library computer access and retrieval system 

    2 computer cores : 
        center of the primay hull saucer 
        engineering section 

        each incorporates a series of miniature subspace field generators
        which processes data faster than the speed of light 

        information is carried by a complext network of optical fiber conduits 








SENORS 

a collection of scientific instruments which provid einformation 
Sensors is a catchall term for various instruments 

sensor arrays are located around the hull of fthe ship 
main sensor at front of the engineering hull which sweeps ahead of teh ship for hazards 

tricorders 
    handheld devices that contain a sensor array 
    which detect a variety of phenomena

    equipped with small remote peripheral sensors which can be used for very fine work 

    tricorders can't sense neutrinos or subspace phenomena





PROBES 

a small unmanned intrument that has sensors for probing space 
and returning sensor information 

used for general information gathering that are beyond 
ship's sensor range 

probes are launched from the photon torpedo launchers

types 
    class 1 = short range, various instrument devices 
    class 3 = probes intended for entry into a planet's atmosphere 
    class 8 = capable of warp travel and based on photon torpedo spaceframe







SUBSPACE RADIO 

faster than light means of communications 

speed of subspace radio 
    radio propagates at max speed of warp factor 9.9999
    limitation is that this speed falls off dramatically over time as the warp fields decay 

    within Federation space there are ample network relays and boosters to avoid issues 
    outside Federation space there is no network so the message decays faster







TURBOLIFTS 

turbo-elevators are capable of travelling both vertically and horizontally 

turbolifts connect to every deck and section

voice command 

Jefferies Tubes and ladder wells can also be used to transport between decks 





LIFEBOATS 

Several hundred lifeboats are avilable for extreme emergency 
lifeboats are pods that get ejected from small hatches in rows along the ship's exterior 






COMMUNICATORS 

Starfleet uniform badge communicators 
activated by voice and touch 

range = 60,000 kms 

can be used as a homing beacon which transporters can 
determine exact coordinates 

companels located throughout the ships can be used 
as communicators which are equipped with dermal sensors 








PERSONAL PHASERS 

normal sidearms used by crew 

settings
    stun = render target unconscious 
    cut = cutting torch 
    disrupt = vaporizes target 

types 
    type 1 = small, keychain size , limited number of shots 
    type 2 = medium size 
    type 3 = large, phaser rifle 








FOOD SERVICE TECHNOLOGY

food service transporter terminals called food slots 
can materialize any dish that is within the computer's memory 

recreate matter at the molecular resolution level 
which duplicate nutritional properties and taste 











SPACEFLIGHT & THE GALAXY

when the ship orbits a planet it is called standard orbit 
usually 35,000 kms altitude

Class M planet = Earth like 

courses and directions 
    "a ship Bearing 104, Mark 12" [both are degrees]
    indicates the degrees of measurement
    both numbers should be less than 360

    bearing = 2 angles relative to the Enterprise
    heading/ mark  = angles measured relative to the galaxy itself 

    "bearing 090" == a right turn, from your reference point (the ship)
    "heading 090" = a left turn, relative to earth 


sectors 
    primary unit of measure in known space 
    each sector is 20 light years across which contain dozens of solar systems 

    a ship travelling at warp factor 6 take 19 days to cross a sector (4 days at warp 9.6)

    sector numbers and names 
        sectors have a 3 to 6 digit numbering system (Sector 18834)
        but can have common names named by their major star systems/ planets 

        Earth is Sector 001 (Sol Sector)
        Starbase 515 was located in the Scylla Sector 

quadrants 
    the galaxy is divided into 4 quadrants 
    each quadrant is 8 billion cubic light years

    quadrants 
        Alpha, Beta, Delta and Gamma 
    
    Federation is at the boundary between Alpha and Beta quadrants 


galactic coordinates 
    a set of 3 numbers for setting the course 
    example: "set course for 394345 by 885354 by 032234"


starbases 
    Starfleet Command maintains a network of over 500 support and operation facilities through Federation space 
    these starbases are next level on chain of command 














THE FEDERATION 

The United Federation of Planets (UFP) consists of 150 different planets 
and various lifeforms 

primary political oranization 


STARFLEET 

organization dedicated to exploration, diplomacy, research and defense (military) 
but is not military minded

































SECTION II - TECHNICAL MEMORANDA


impulse power 
    a magnetic accelerator and a set of compact subspace driver coils 
    superhot plasma is sped up within the accelerator and the power 
    is taken from here to run the driver coils 

    these coils perform continuum distortion needed to bring the ship 0.999 of 
    the speed of light 

    combined mass of the components is 5 million metric tons and 
    exhaust thrust would not work in propulsion

    fuel supply for fusion reactors is a set of large conformal tanks of liquid
    deuterium and tritium (-425F) both isotopes of hydrogen



warp power 
    requires massive amount of energy 
    matter and antimatter forced together => power to run warp field generators on the outboard nacelles

    before long missions, the ship purges their matter antimatter storage tanks and 
    refilled in form of antihydrogen liquid

    magnetic injectors operate like precision spray nozzles and are located at either end of the warp engine core 
    these injectors are primes and reaction begins when minute amounts of matter antimatter plasma collide in the 
    core (engine pressure vessel) . matter : antimatter is 25:1 and the engine is idle 

    normal pressure is slowly raised to 10,000 PSI (715 times atmospheric pressure)
    reactions occur until the vessel is full (ratio is 10:1)
    a ratio of 1:1 is reached during warp factor 8, higher warp require more reactants but the ratio stays the same 

    antiprotons will destroy anything so residual hasses will be used up 
    Engine Control computers automatically keep the mixture balanced

    a small onboard antimatter generator is in the lower engineering hull 
    it can produce small amounts of antimatter from normal matter using a 
    quantum state reversal device (flips the charge and spin of normal matter), 
    the ratio is energy hungry of 1 atom antimatter to 10 atoms of normal matter {not cost effective}

    Bussard Ram collector scoop allows to collect some interstellar hydrogen atoms during travel 



dilithium crystals 
    dilithium crystals are required for a regulated continuous thermonuclear process 

    dilithium {dilithium diallosilicate heptoferranide} works to fine tune 
    the radiated energy of the reaction into the 2 power transfer tunnels to the warp nacelles
    the exposed crystal assembly extends into the core. 

    radiation of different frequencies enters the lattice structure of the crystal
    and is bounced and bent around, the crystal exist in a narrow frequency range down the power transfer tunnels

    the bright light is photon spill, harmless but the patterns are valuable indicator to the engineer on duty as 
    to how smoothly the engine is running 

    if dilithium crystals shatter or melt, a cold shutdown may occur 
        a fast runaway reaction which would heat the core to unacceptable levels even if the injectors are shut off 

    if the pressure vessel of the core is breached, 
        the contained plasma would have to be vented into space explosively 
        and hope the force fields around the core protect crew from 30,000 degrees F gasses 

    normal operating = the plasma carries power to the nacelles where warp field generators are energized

    larger nacelles = higher speeds 



dilithium in warp engine reactors 

    dilithium crystals are needed in warp engines 

    dilithium in its 5th phase crystal form is the only material discovered in nature or manufactured 
    that can withstand exposure to antimatter
    dilithium lattice structure is arranged in a way that antimatter is held suspended in the empty space 
    between atoms when crystal is subjected to high frequency electromagnetic field in the megawatt range 

    the Federation scientists discovered dilithium

    matter (above) + antimatter (below)
        into separated injection reactors (both)
            collide 
                reaction ! 

                    antiprotons slip through the crystal and travel to opposite face 
                    some antimatter spray off the main stream but upwards of 90% will remain tightly bound in 1 column 
                    and confined by the core's magnetic coils and assist in secondary reactions to maintain engine 
                    temperature and pressure

                    primary reatcion takes place at the exit face of the crystal
                    radiation byproducts are kept within a narrow frequency range 
                    
                    lower frequency emissions are shifted upwards and higher ones shifted downwards 

                    energy from the primary reaction is split into 2 plasma streams at equal angles from the ship centerline 
                    streams are magnetically channelled along the power transfer  tubes to the warp engine nacelles

                    the crystal is housed within an armored cradle in the core and held by a gripper mechanism 
                    gripper moves through 3 axes and acts as power supply for high energy field which allows the 
                    crystal to withstand the antimatter stream 

                    once alignment is made the gripper is energized and the plasma ripples down the  power transfer tubes 
                    and up to the warp nacelles

                    the throttle for each engine is a set of valved plasma injectors  just below the warp driver coils 

                    crystal evaporates at a constant rate if undamaged otherwise asymmetrical plasma stream 

                    dilithium crystals are 89% efficient in warp drive 

                    [crystal vaporized => <--> recrystallized with gas-to-solid phase ]










TRANSPORTER

2 modes 
    beam down 
    beam up 

beam anything from point A to point B 
and can reproduce items including food 

limitation is stored objects have limited resolution 

personnel or cargo transporter has 4 components :
    Upper Pad 
    Lower Pad 
    Pattern Buffer 
    Emitter Array 


Upper & Lower Pads 
    contain equipment necesssary to read an object's molecular and subatomic structure 
    
    pattern = machine internal molecular instructions for breakdown and reassembly

    subsystems 
        molecular imaging scanners
        ionizers 
        power feeds (primary & emergency)
        phase transition coils 
    
    read in molecular stream (into computer memory)
        Pattern Buffer (large cylindrical tank surrounded by superconducting electromagnetic coils)
            {temporary storage}
                beamed away 

    the molecules of object are held in a spinning magnetic suspension 
    which lasts for max 8 minutes before degradation 

    can't produce working duplicate copies of living tissue or organ systems 
    due to the vast amount of information required to disassemble and reassemble a life form
    within the limited computer memory

    the status of object going in transporter will be same coming out, patterns must match. 
    no unhealthy person transported and then a healthy person post transporter 

    only a small percentage of total pattern is held for reassembly in short term memory


Pattern Buffer
    the molecular stream and coded instructions pass through numerous 
    subsystems before reaching the emitter

    Compensators:
        Subspace 
        Doppler
        Heisenberg

    each compensator works to insure the matter stream is being transmitted or received in 
    the correct phase and frequency 


Emitter Array 
    the Enterprise has numerous emitters 

    the matter stream is processed through a device similar to 
    a subspace radio and is sent out 

    each emitter is responsible for targetting the correct reassembly spot 
    and is in harmony with Starfleet communicator in locating crewmembers to beam up 

    beam down 
        2 discrete signals are sent , both travel downward 

        signal 1 is similar to a carrier wave
        
        signal 2 is the (ACB) Annular Confinement Beam
            acts as a tunnel of energy preventing the stream from breaking down as it 
            travels down the center 

    beam up 
        the emitter is configured slightly differently
        ACB stays the same but the matter stream starts at the surface 

        Transporter sends an empty signal to the ground, 
        which intercepts the object to be beamed up, 
        reverses direction and pulls object up with it 

        transporter room ignores the empty signal until it senses 
        the upcoming matter stream for reassembly 


all outgoing/incoming signals travel in subspace and are subject to 
transmission and reception problems 











HOLODECKS - THEORY & OPERATION 

the holodeck basic mechanism is the Omnidirectional Holo Diode 
which projects a variety of electromagnetic fields and there are 
millions of these OHDs in the walls.  

Each OHD is a computer and can manipulate EM fields in 3 dimensions 

other sensory stimuli are from speakers and atomizers as well as
producing objects with the transporter 




TRACTOR BEAM 

tractor beam used for pushing, pulling and holding onto objects 
this is done by the tractor beam emitter which is located under the battle section 

the emitter is a forcefield device that focuses wave /particles like 
gravitons and projecting that field toward its target. The pitch on Enterprise
is 180 degrees and yaw of 360 degrees

if hold 
    set emitter device to attract and repel 

if haul 
    set emitter device to attract 

if push 
    set emitter device to repel 

limitations 
    tractor beam must be less than 20,000 kms
    otherwise the gravitons will disintegrate 

    if object mass is more than 10 million tons the 
    emitter needs to be full power and very close to object 









BASIC TRICORDER OPERATION 

the standard tricorder is a protable sensing, computing and 
data communication device 

controls: 

    PWR STBY 
        power standby light. if tricorder is not used more than 10 minutes 
        the device goes into low power mode and any new touch will bring the 
        device back to full power

    F1-F2
        control function select switch, many buttons have more than 1 function 
        this selects alternative functions
        this operates in data operations only 

    I or E 
        these 2 buttons are sensory controls, internal and external 
        they control the source of the remote sensing information
        either the tricorder itself or remote device 

        remote device can be any sensor that uses same data collection 
        machine language

    ALPHA BETA DELTA GAMMA 
        these 4 lights indicate the tracks being read off the library crystal cartridges 

    LIBRARY A/B 
        this is the slot for cartridge which are stowed in a pack in the back of tricorder
    
    DISPLAY SCREEN 
        the main display capable of showing any real time, stored or computed image 

    DEVICE INPUT 
        3 buttons GEO MET BIO 
        select between external sensing devices 
        3 small lights to the right indicate which functions are active 
    
    COM TRANSMISSION 
        tricorder can receive and transmit pictures and data 
        1st button toggles 1 way receive ACPT and network POOL 
        2nd button toggles between ship-to-tricorder (INTRSHP) and other tricorders (TRICRDR)
        both modes can be active at same time 

    EMRG 
        emergency "dump everything to the ship" button 
        a non-error checking burst mode data transmission 

    IMAGE RECORD 
        button has 4 divisions 
            Forward 
            Reverse 
            Input 
            Erase 
        these are image memory controls for sequential image files 
        approximately 120 frames per second sampling rate 

    LIBRARY B 
        primarily an image storage area 
        I and E control the source of the images 

    ID 
        touchpad that can be used to personalize the 
        tricorder for default power up settings or as 
        security setting
