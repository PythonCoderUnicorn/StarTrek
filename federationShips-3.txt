PATROL COMBATANTS

Two of the four vessels of the Entente class dreadnought have completed their outfitting and
are now on patrol duties. At this time, there are no plans for any additional dreadnought
construction, nor is Star Fleet actively looking at any new designs.
The new Defiant class of escort is currently entering full production with a final build rate of
five per year expected around 2380. At this time funding for twenty of these vessels has been
approved, though that number is expected to at least double, if not triple, in the years ahead
as these ships look to be an excellent value.

SHUTTLECARRIERS

At this time, no additional vessels of the Courageous class have been built and funding for the
second through fourth vessels has been formally cancelled before construction could begin. As
for Courageous herself, she is expected to remain close to Romulan space for the time being.

SPACE CONTROL SHIPS

Mistrusted and misunderstood since their inception in 2285, the Space Control ship’s future
remains with the three vessels of the Griffon class, which performed great service during the
Dominion War. However, Star Fleet has yet to convince the Federation Council to fund additional
vessels. Perhaps their heavy role in the rebuilding process might change this but, at this time, it is
expected that these three ships will remain the limit.

COMMAND SHIPS

The large Fleet actions against the Dominion reinforced the need for Star Fleet to begin
consideration of building more Command Cruisers. Though three vessels of the Sovereign-based
Whitehall class have been constructed, they are far too expensive for additional production. A
proposal has been drafted for a command ship based on the Intrepid class cruiser. It is currently
under review by the ASDB and SSDAC.

FLEET AUXILLIARY VESSELS

With the massive movement of supplies, materials, and personnel needed to begin the task
of rebuilding the Federation, a large number of auxiliary ships have been authorized for
construction. The MacPherson (TR 64381) class will be more than doubled in size from the current
forty ships to one hundred. In addition, the remaining vessels of the old Doppler and Dollond
classes have been recalled from mothballs and pressed into service on the closer runs, where
there slower speeds are not as much an issue.

SHIP CLASSIFICATIONS




Star Fleet ships and small craft are classified by type and by sequence within that type. The list of
classifications (by approval of the Federation Commissioner for Star Fleet) is issued periodically,
updating a system begun in 2208. Star Fleet’s current list, based on a format developed in 2290,
seeks to offer the most comprehensive definition of the types and missions undertaken by the
ships of the Star Fleet.

The following classifications are contained on the current list.

A NOTE ABOUT REGISTRIES

this is the Belknap class strike cruiser. Twenty vessels were originally envisioned for this class, and
the numbers 2500-2519 were assigned to it. The Ascension class dreadnought, itself a variant of           For large vessels like the Galaxy, Nebula, and Sovereign classes, vessels are generally ordered

dreadnoughts fell out of favor and the Ascension class was halted at ten (2530), leaving a gap
of six unused numbers. This was later filled by the six vessels of the Impervious class (CA 2531),
which were specifically assigned those NCC numbers for just that purpose.

In 2315, the Office of Starship Registry decided to assign registry numbers in blocks of 100 to the
various starship construction facilities within the Federation. As a vessel was commissioned at
each facility, it would be assigned the next available number in that block. When a block was
expired, it would be assigned a new block of 100 registries. This policy was first instituted with the
Deneva class of scoutships, the lead vessel being assigned the number 6200 from the pool 6200-
6299 assigned to the San Francisco Fleet Yards where it was produced.

Highly controversial at the time, the new policy did eliminate the waste of NCC numbers.
However, to the layman, NCC numbers are now strewn about with what appears to be no
apparent rhyme or reason. In fact, while NCC numbers across classes have no definable

in earnest, with changes made in the yard to try and correct the deficiencies. The ship was
completed and began her shakedown tests in 2368. These trials were an absolute disaster. The
initial simulations did not do justice to the actual problems with her flight and structure dynamics.
The engineer’s quickly determined that the propulsion system was far too powerful for such a
small ship. Though she was designed for bursts of up to Warp 9.99, in actuality the ship’s structure
could barely handle Warp 9 without risk of coming apart. After these tests, the ASDB declared
the design a failure and mothballed the program pending a complete re-evaluation. Instead,
the Courageous class was given the go-ahead and the first vessel was started. With the coming
of the Dominion threat, plans were again floated to return the Defiant to the yards and finish her
out. It was felt that a large vessel would attract too much attention and the Defiant’s smaller
size would work. Most surprisingly, the Romulans approved of this plan, going as far as to offer a
cloaking device and Tactical Advisor for the vessel. The ship was returned to the yards in 2370
and the vessel formally entered service in 2372, assigned to Deep Space Nine. Since that time,
the Defiant class has proven herself time and time again in a variety of missions. Though the
original ship was flawed, work continued on refining the concept and making it more stable.
Continued simulation eventually resulted in new changes that resulted in a far more effective
ship and a prototype, the U.S.S. Valiant, was commissioned. The new vessel proved to be a far
better prospect than the original Defiant, but she was lost on a secret mission inside Dominion
space.
Conclusion: Though not effective against the Borg, the Defiant proved quite effective against
Dominion (Cardassian and Jem’Hadar) vessels. As the Dominion War heated up, a crash
construction program was authorized that saw nine vessels started in 2373, all of them entering
service in the final months of the war.
Nomenclature: The Sao Paulo (ES 75633) was renamed to Defiant by order of the Chief of Fleet
Operations to replace the original, lost in battle against the Breen at Chin’Toka. It kept the
original NCC, however.

Pack Isolinear III computer system.

As opposed to using the specialized prototype test crew (Cathedral Unit), the original test crew
for the Bright Star were selected from various personnel who were chosen for their particular
skills and experience aboard Galaxy and Nebula class starships. This was due to the significant
changes that had been incorporated into the Galaxy (II) class as well as Admiral Wallace’s
desire to train an R&D testing crew who would also serve as the ship’s Command Crew. It was
thus composed of some of Starfleet’s best officers in each discipline, and all are considered
experts in their respective fields. Of Bright Star’s original Command Crew, five were members
of the Federation Kempo Team for 2370, and they therefore chose “Team Kempo” as their
