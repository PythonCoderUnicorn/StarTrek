 INTRODUCTION

Through the over three decades of Star Trek, one species, more than any other, has captured
 the imagination of the fans: the Klingons. Countless thousands of words have been writ en about their
 culture, language, history, and weapons. Now their starships are receiving the same treatment.

 The Ship Recognit on Manual, Vol. Three: Starships of the Klingon Empire                                                                         tells you everything
 you ever wanted to know about Klingon ships, from the tin est shut le to the largest battleship. It’s got
 new technol gy, new rules for Klingon ships, and of course plenty of Starship Templates for Klingon
 vessels.

To use this book, you should also have Spacedock: The Advanced Starship Construction and
Combat Manual , available as a download from TrekRPG.Net. Otherwise the Starship Templates may
prove somewhat confusing. You’ll probably also find it helpful to have the first two SRMs, which
cover canon Starfleet vessels and Cardassian vessels, respectively.

SRM3: Klingons includes several ships that previously appeared elsewhere, such as the                                                          Vor’cha
 and K’Vort classes. Any Starship Templates in this book supercede those published in earlier volumes.
 The versions in this book use Klingon-specific rules and, where necessary, cor ect erro s in the origi-
 nal templates.


Chapter One, Klingon Ship Classification  , describes how the Klingons classify their starships.
 It includes lists of representative classes of ships for each ship category.

Chapter Two, Klingon Ship Construction  , provides special rules and guidelines for construct-
 ing Klingon ships. Though you generally build Klingon ships using the standard                                                                                              Spacedock         rules,
 there are a few important changes to reflect the nature of the Empire’s starship technol gy.

Chapter Three, The Klingon Ship Registry , contains Starship Templates for nearly 30 vessels of
 the Klingon Empire–warships, cruisers, destroyers, you name it.

Qapla’!

                      The Empire has fewer Surveyors and
 Research/Laboratory vessels, both in type and
 number, than any of the other major galactic
 civil zations. Though they understand the value
 of expansion and knowledge, they simply don’t
 appreciate the need for or enjoy exploration as
 much as the Federation, the Romulans, or the
 Cardassians do. Few Klingon warrio s regard an
 extended tour on a Surveyor or laboratory ship
 as anything more than a thinly-disguised repri-
 mand.
                      Klingon support and auxil ary vessels
 showed their worth during the Domin War,
 when ships like Mil tary Freighters, Armo ed
 Transports, Occupation Transports, and the ubiq-
 uito s              SoQa - and                  Toron -class shut lecraft proved
 their ability to withstand more punishment than
 comparative Federation or Romulan vessels.
 Withou them, the Federation alliance would
 have found it much more difficult to keep its
 supply lines open.
 KLINGON STARSHIP NAMES
                       Most Klingon ships use the prefix I.K S.
 (Imperial Klingon Ship), even if they belong to
 one of the Great House fleets. For reasons of tra-
 dition and polit cs, most Klingon com anders
 prefer to maintain the fiction that the Emperor
 ultimately rules them and owns their ships. They
 do not have registry numbers displayed on their
 hul s the way Starfleet vessels do, preferring to
 restrict that information to identification beacons
 and the like. Ship names are chosen by the ship’s
 designer, com issioner, or first captain, depend-

        On Klingon vessels, a ship’s Passenger complement often greatly exceeds its crew, sometimes by as much as 200-500%. This reflects the way Klingons
        use their ships to transport large numbers of troops. A ship’s Evac complement typically ranges from 5-15 times the size of its Crew (again, this may
        vary from ship to ship).

port becomes level with the user’s eyes; it takes
one round for the periscope to deploy. Once
deployed, it provides a +1 bonus to the vessel’s
Shipboard Systems (Tactical) Tests to hit targets.
However, because it requires the user’s complete
attention, he suffers a -1 Test Result penalty on
all other Tests he makes in any round in which
he uses it (except for in t ative Tests).

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
Fleet data:                   Used by many Great Houses as a
long-range patrol, escort, and courier ship, the
BaH’reth            -class Frigate is the most com on Frig-
ate found in the Empire. Though not as fast and
maneuverable as the                         HajHal          class, it possesses
greater firepower, an asset any true Klingon can
appreciate.
                The     BaH’reth        ’s design employs the typical
Klingon “winged shaft” shape, but with a mark-
edly different configuration from most such ves-

 DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
 Fleet data:                          Entering service only a few months
 before the Klingon-Cardassian War, and the
 Domin War which fol owed, the                                                        Brakt    -class
 Fast Atack Ship proved itself in battle almost ime-
 diately. Its combination of speed and advanced
 tactical systems, combined with its sleek good
 lo ks, made it a popular alternative to the                                                    B’rel -
 class Light Warship in the eyes of many Klingons,
 and its many victories justified their opinio s.
                    Roughly resembling a cross between a
 K’t’inga -class Battle Cruiser and a                                         B’rel -class Light
 Warship, but with a shortened shaft (to reduce
 the forward module’s vulnerability) and swept-
 back, tucked-in pylons, the                                            Brakt  -class’s appear-
 ance suggests the speed and maneuverability for
 which it has become well-know . It has a fairly
 standard complement of disruptors and torpe-
 does, plus a powerful Forward Disruptor Canno
 adapted from some larger Klingon vessels. While
 the canno greatly increases the ship’s firepower,
 it can also cause unpredictable power surges
 throughout the ship because it draws so much
 power. With new usage data from the Domin
 War in hand, Klingon engineers are trying to solve
 this problem.
                    Forward Disruptor Canno :                                        The    Brakt’s
 canno requires +5 Power for every shot due to
 the difficulties invol ed in integrating such a large
 beam weapon into a relatively small ship. Addi-
 tionally, if the ship ever suffers a Dramatic Fail-
 ure on any Test to hit a target with the canno ,
 the weapon burns out, requir ng the crew to com-
 pletely replace it.

 Noteworthy vessels/service records/encounters:
 I.K S. Brakt                , prot ype;         I.K S. Tor’joq               , played a
 key role in crucial raid on Jhegaru XII ketracel-
 white processing facility (2374);                              I.K S. Kron t         , res-
 cued crew of stranded                          B’rel -class vessel before
 Jem’Hadar found them (2375).

                 Most                 B’rel -class Light Warships have crews
of about 12. However, in wartime or when con-
flict is expected, the “passengers” are actually
fellow soldiers who function as additional crew,
giving the vessel a complement of three dozen or
more.
                 Although the Klingons have since designed
many ships which function better and carry greater
firepower than the                               B’rel , it remains the most pop-
ular and com only-encountered ship in the Klin-
gon fleets. There are several reasons for this. First,
it’s a tried and true design, tested over the course
of a century, and many Klingons are comfortable
with it. Second, as the ship which led the Klin-
gons to victories over the Romulans and many
other enemies, it has a certain nostalgic quality
that appeals to tradition-m ded Klingons. Third,
and perhaps most importantly, it’s cheap to man-
ufacture and use. Poorer Houses, and even the
IKDF itself, find they can build and field entire
wings of                   B’rels for the cost of a single larger, more
advanced vessel–and sometimes it’s the number
of guns one has, not their size or technol gical
sophistication, that matters.

B’REL VARIANTS
                 The Klingons have created many different
B’rel variants. The most com on, the D12 class
Bird of Prey, has a targeting periscope in front
of the captain’s chair (see page 11; this costs an
additional 3 SUs). However, necessary modifica-
tions to the cloaking device create defects in the
D12’s plasma coil. If an attacker hits the ship with
a low- evel ion c pulse, the cloak automatically

 DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
 Fleet data:                      A mainstay of the Klingon fleet for over
 ten years, the                           Denn’lar              -class Armo ed Transport
 has carried more Klingon tro ps into battle than
 any other existing class of transport. Designed for
 util y rather than visual appeal, it lo ks like “a
 rhino floating on top of two big warp nacelles,” in
 the words of one Starfleet officer. By pul ing the
 nacelles and other parts of the ship in close to the
 trapezohedral main hul , the ship maxim zes its
 tro p-carrying capacity and min zes its vulner-
 ability to attack.
                      With its atmospheric and planetfall capa-
 bility, the                  Denn’lar               can drop out of warp just out-
 side a contested system, dash to the target planet
 at high impulse, and then set down and drop
 off its load of tro ps withou having to transfer
 them to another vessel or use transporters. Large
 doors on the port and starboard sides fold out-
 ward to form ramps that warrio s use to exit the
 ship quickly. The ship can maintain its shields
 while opening the doors, but of course must deac-
 tivate them before taking off, lest it drag the dis-
 embarked soldiers to their deaths in the upper
 atmosphere.

 Noteworthy vessels/service records/encounters:
 I.K S. Denn’lar                  , prot ype;     I.K S. Krotal                               , provided
 several squads of reinforcements to Ajilon Prime
 despite heavy Starfleet fire (2373),                                               I.K S. NejneQ           ,
 landed tro ps safely on Chin’toka after suffering
 severe damage from a Jem’Hadar attack (2374).

 no s proved tactically advantageous. Some Klin-
 gon officers who observed the                                Defiant           -class Heavy
 Escort’s pulse phasers in action developed a way
 to feed extra Power to the canno s and link them
 to create a crude sort of “pulse disruptor” which
 inflicted tremendous damage on Jem’Hadar ships.
 The ship’s solid construction and general lack
 of exploitable weaknesses helped to keep a far
 greater percentage of these vessels intact than
 most types of Klingon warships.
                     Pulse Disruptors:                 To create “pulse disrup-
 tors” using the                              Felg’ra ’s twin forward disruptor
 canno s, the Tactical Officer must fire both at
 once while supplying an extra 5 Power to each.
 To do this, he makes a Moderate (8) Shipboard
 Systems (Tactical) Test (the Multiple Action Pen-
 alty does not apply to this Test). If that Test suc-
 ceeds, he then makes a single normal Test to fire
 both disruptors (incur ing no Multiple Action Pen-
 alty for firing both, but suffering a -1 Multiple
 Action Penalty for firing in the same round as
 link g the disruptors together). He must fire the
 disruptors in pulse mode, and if he hits, each
 one does +30 damage. He cannot Multifire the
 twin canno s, nor use them as part of a multi-
 ple-weapon Multifire, but may fire them multiple
 times in the round if he can afford the Power and
 Multiple Action Penalty for doing so. If he wishes
 to use the “pulse disruptors” next round, he must
 make another Test to maintain the “link” between
 them.

 bly, playing a significant role in every Klingon-
 led offensive during the Domin War.                                                 GeljoQs
 often acted as the anchors of Federation alliance
 ship formations.
                   But the constant fighting of the early 2370s
 also revealed some of the                                     Gel’joQ’s      weaknesses.
 For example, it is slower and less maneuverable
 than the Jem’Hadar Battle Cruisers it often faced,
 leading to unacceptably high losses in some bat-
 tles. Upgrades introduced towards the end of the
 war did not ful y cor ect this disparity. Nor did
 they elim nate the “softening” of the aft shield
 junctions when the ship moved at high impulse
 speeds. Klingon design engineers have begun
 studying these problems and hope to devise solu-
 tions soon.
                   Aft shield junctions:                             When the         Gel’joQ
 moves at impulse speeds of .6c or higher, the
 impulse engines interfere with the aft shields
 slightly, causing an uncor ectable weakening.
 Reduce the aft shield’s junctures with the port
 and starboard shields by 25 Protection. Enemy
 ships which specifically lo k for weaknesses in
 the ship’s shields can detect this problem with a
 Challenging (9) Shipboard Systems (Sensors) Test.
 They must target the junction using the normal
 rules for doing so (                         Spacedock            , page 135).

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
Fleet data:                          Introduced into the Klingon fleets at
the begin i g of the Klingon-Cardassian War, the
Goralis                 -class Incursion Cruiser quickly became a
favorite of warrio s who favor raiding, maneu-

ward battles. While sufficiently well-armed and
shielded to take part in any type of fleet engage-

to the types of missions for which House Frel’kar
designed it: lightni g-fast incursions into enemy

 DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
 Fleet data:                         The     Jen’thar -class Assault Cruiser, a
 relatively old Klingon ship type used for longer-
 term exploration or attack missions, shows the
 influence of Starfleet design principles. Unlike
 most Klingon ships, its nacelle pylons sweep
 upward and aft, suggesting a bird of prey sto p-
 ing to strike its target. The central body stretches
 aft slightly beyond the pylons, and forward to
 narrow and terminate in a typically Klingon com-
 mand hul which also boasts a formidable weap-
 ons pod.
                     Unlike the more com on                      B’rel and K’Vort
 class vessels, the Klingons designed the                                       Jen’thar
 for longer-term missions of exploration or attack.
 Thus it was well-suited to the Domin War,
 where Klingon ships often spent long periods of
 time far away from Klingon space.

 Noteworthy vessels/service records/encounters:
 I.K S. Jen’thar                       , prot ype;              I.K S. VeS’tang       , crippled
 an enemy wing during the Second Battle of Vulca-
 nis (2374);                I.K S. Mektar                  , destroyed five Jem’Hadar
 At ack Fighters during attack on Chin’toka (2374);
 I.K S. Gor’Vas                         , destroyed Breen battleship in a sui-
 cide run during the final assault on Chin’toka, cre-

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
Fleet data:                Developed just in time for the Domin-
ion War, the                      Kelirax          -class Scout served admira-
bly in countless recon missions and raids behind
enemy lines. It resembles a small, elongated                                           B’rel -
class bird of prey with more rounded wings pul ed
in closer to the body. This structure improves the
strength and efficiency of its shield bubble and
cloaking device.

Noteworthy vessels/service records/encounters:
I.K S. Kelirax                       , prot ype;       I.K S. Chav’qar           , detected
Domin supply convoy en route to Bolian front
in time for Federation alliance forces to destroy the
convoy, helping to drive the enemy back (2374);
I.K S. Rogh                     , gathered intelligence on Chin’toka
system prior to first Federation-Kli gon-Romulan
alliance assault there (2375).

 DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
 Fleet data:                     Most Klingon warrio s consider the
 Kel’var -class Heavy Frigate the most powerful and
 effective of all Klingon Frigates. Virtually every
 Great House has at least a few of these ships in
 its fleet. Designed for long-term border patrols
 and other extended missions, it has a sturdy struc-
 tural frame and advanced SIF, making it superbly
 suited for search and rescue situations, support of
 colonies in dangerous territo es, and other mis-
 sions where it might experience forms of hul
 stress.
                 The        Kel’var             features four warp nacelles and
 a modified version of the typical Klingon “winged
 shaft” design. With its thicker, shorter central
 body, and shorter forward shaft, it has a reduced
 dorsal-ventral profile compared to most Klingon
 ships. The four wing pylons (arranged in dorsal-
 ventral pairs on each side of the ship) likewise
 have a smaller profile which the designers created
 by angling the “wing” pylons in more towards

Warship in all respects, with a few notable excep-
tions. First, the forward module contains primarily
sensors instead of weapons, and has a wedge/
arrowhead shape instead of an ov id shape.
Second, the wing pylons have a slightly different
shape, and carry on their tips warp nacelles
instead of disruptor canno s.
                      The Empire frequently sells older                           Kleg-Tas
to civil an researchers and institu ons. These per-
sons typically repaint them, refit them slightly,
and then send them right back out to conti ue
their scientific pursuits

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
Fleet data:                          Newest and most advanced of the
Klingon Vessels, the                                K’mpec -class Heavy Warship
first began construction in 2376 after a planni g
and design period of nearly ten years. Named
after the late Chancellor, it is intended to become
the Empire’s new “front line” warship, displacing
the         Vor’cha class from that role.
                    When designing the                         K’mpec , Klingon engi-
neers used the basic structure, spaceframe, and
system requirements for the                                       Vor’cha -class Heavy
Warship, but increased its dimensions so the ship
is larger than its predecessor, but stil smaller
than the                Negh’Var . They moved the warp nacelles
backwards slightly, to obtain an improved warp
profile, and attached the wedge-shaped dorsal
module to the ship’s body more closely and
firmly, to prevent certain catastrophic explosions
which occur ed on damaged                                          Vor’chas during the
Domin War. Most un sually, they moved the
axehead-shaped bridge module from the dorsal
side of the forward shaft to the ventral side, giving
the ship a profile unlike that of any other ship of
the Empire.
                    Some Great Houses, particularly those with
business interests relating to the manufacture of
the         Negh’Var , argued that the I.K D F. should con-
vert the                  Negh’Var             into a distinct ship class and
com ission an all-new, even larger and more
powerful flagship for the Empire. Unfortunately
for them, the High Council was dubious about
this suggestion; on its recom endation, Chancel-
lor Martok rejected the proposal and proceeded
with the                 K’mpec Construction Program.

 DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
 Fleet data:                           Evol ed from the D7-class Battle
 Cruiser of the mid- to late 2 0 s, and in fact
 first manufactured during the latter part of that
 period, the                  K’t’inga -class Battle Cruiser has filled
 the ranks of the Klingon space forces for nearly
 a century–a testament to its durability and adapt-
 ability. Although relatively lightly armed and
 protected compared to many modern ships, it
 nevertheless remains an important and effective
 part of the Klingon fleet.
                  Physically, the                       K’t’inga consists of a broad
 main hul which vaguely possesses a batwing pro-
 file when viewed dorsally or ventrally, and whose
 “wings” flare out to terminate in warp nacelles;
 a long, narrow forward shaft, and an axehead-
 shaped forward module with a bridge module
 mounted to it dorsally. The forward shaft has
 proved to be a vulnerability–enemy attacks can
 sever it, split ng the bridge off from the main

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
Fleet data:                       Built using the same plans as the                      B’rel -
class Light Warship, but to larger dimensions,
the            K’Vort         -class Warship serves prominently in
the Imperial Klingon Defense Forces and many
House mil taries. While not as powerful or sophis-
ticated as the                               Vor’cha -class Heavy Warship, it is
cheaper to build and maintain, making it attrac-
tive to many poorer Houses.
                    Unlike the                        B’rel , the   K’Vort  -class vessel
has only two flight modes, “attack” and “flight”;
it lacks atmospheric capability, and so does not
need a “landing” mode. However it avoids one of
the           B’rel’s chief weaknesses by placing two dis-
ruptor canno s and one torpedo launcher aft. Its
disruptor canno s often fire in tandem (                                          i.e. , as a
Multifire attack).
                    The          K’Vort’s primary crew numbers only
about 350. However, it is designed to serve as a
tro p transport, and can carry about 1,20 more
person el if need be.
                    The dimensions listed for the                          K’Vort      repre-
sent an average length. Due to individual House
preferences, resource availability, and other con-
siderations, they can range in size from about 250
meters in length to close to 700 meters. However,
all should be considered Size 7 for game pur-
poses (unless the Narrator wants to prepare sepa-
rate templates for the larger ships).

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
Fleet data:                      The largest and most powerful ship in
the Empire, the                           Negh’Var             serves as the flagship for
the Imperial Klingon Defense Forces, and as the
Chancellor’s personal battleship. If he does not
feel like com anding it himself, he designates a
favored warrio to captain it in his stead.
                      The          Negh’Var               epitomizes the “winged
shaft” design favored by Klingon ship designers.
Two broad “wings” stretch straight out from the
aft half of the shaft; they do not curve down ard
or upward as on most Klingon ships. The wings
have a vaguely crescent shape; powerful disrup-
tors tip the forward-point g “horns” of the cres-
cent. The wings also hold the ship’s four warp
nacelles–one above and below each wing.
                      The aft dorsal area of the ship includes
a large wedge-shaped section about 20 meters
thick. This area contains the ship’s bridge and sev-
eral other important facilties. Although its eleva-
tion above the rest of the ship appears to render it
vulnerable, in fact the engineers who designed the
ship arranged its shield generators so the shields
are particularly strong in that area, making it one
of the ship’s best-protected parts. Rumors and
intelligence analyses speculate that the wedge can
detach from the ship and fly under its own power,
much like the bridge module on an Intrepid-class
Light Explorer. However, the High Council con-
sistently denies these reports.
                      The          Negh’Var                has heavier and more
advanced weaponry than any other Klingon ship.
Its forward “notched axehead” module contains
a Type 13 disruptor canno possessing enough
power to destroy an unshielded target with just a
few shots. Twenty Type 12 disruptor arrays back
up the disruptor canno , providing the ship with
multiple arcs of fire on any target. Four torpedo
launchers (one in the forward module, one aft,
and two dorsal near the “wedge”) ensure that the
ship can also attack any target with torpedoes.
                      Only the fiercest and brightest Klingon war-
rio s earn the right to serve on the                                             Negh’Var . By
Klingon law, the Chancellor can cho se any war-
rio from any House to fill a position on the flag-
ship, and most warrio s consider it a great hon r
for the head of the High Council to cho se them.
                      Designer’s Note:                             The   Negh’Var         violates
the SU lim tations for a Size 8 ships by such a
margin that it would have to be a Size 11 ship to
have that many SUs legally. This, unfortunately, is
one of those situations where canon information–

Assault Cruiser combines speed, maneuverability,
and firepower into “the perfect attack cruiser,”
according to the renowned General Hrang’ta. It
features many un sual systems variations, includ-
ing: disruptors crosswired directly into the warp
engines to increase their power and decrease the
time needed to ready them from “cold” status
(see below); shield grid arrangements allowing
for more efficient power flow to the shields; and

 DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
 Fleet data:                    Designed to perform scouting and
 recon aissance missions into territo y to danger-
 ous for ordinary scouts, quick raids and strikes
 against enemy positions, and escort duties for
 ships entering combat zones, the                                Qa’cheng -class
 Strike Frigate has quickly become a favorite of
 many Klingon warrio s since its introduction into
 the fleet in 2371. Its combination of speed,
 maneuverability, and offensive power makes it fit
 many warrio s’ tactical preferences perfectly.
                      The       Qa’cheng            has an axehead-shaped
 detachable forward module containi g a power-
 ful disruptor canno , with the bridge im ediately
 aft of the module in a trapezoidal-shaped section
 occupying the dorsal part of the forward third of
 the central shaft. The shaft broadens shortly before
 con ecting to the main hul , a roughly rectangu-
 lar-shaped structure topped by a wedge-shaped
 superstructure. Wing pylons curving forward and
 down project from the aft dorsal edges of the main

the port and starboard sides of the central shaft,
rather than the tip of the shaft as on most Klingon
vessels, they give the fighter more power than
most comparative vessels.                                             Suv’tIS   pilots refer to
them as                   tlhaH              (“Talons”). Additionally, the ship
mounts forward and aft disruptors.
                   The          Suv’tIS            has the “winged shaft” design
com on to Klingon ships, but with the wing
pylons thrusting sharply forward and down, giving
the ship a much sleeker appearance than a                                                          B’rel -
class Light Warship. In the eyes of many, it super-
ficially resembles the twin-bladed ice skate used
by Betazoids.
                   Like many small Klingon vessels, the                                         Suv’tIS
has atmospheric and planetfall capability. When
it has to land, it raises its wings and deploys three
landing pads.

 DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
 Fleet data:                 The    Torath     -class Heavy Warship is
 a variant of the                Vor’cha -class Heavy Warship. It
 has a central body and Engineering hul like the
 Vor’cha , but its nacelle pylons sweep forward as
 well as down, giving it a slight bird of prey-like
 appearance. A typical axehead-shaped module on
 the forward end of the main hul contains the
 bridge.
              The        Torath        carries as much heavy arma-
 ment as the              Vor’cha , though its weapons load dif-
 fers significantly: it has fewer disruptors and more

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
Fleet data:                              The      Tro’Qa -class Destroyer has a
somewhat ungainly appearance. Engineers based
its primary and com and hul s on the                                           B’rel -class
Light Warship, but instead of put ing disruptors
on its “wings,” they chose to place four warp
nacelles there instead: one at the end of each
pylon, and one on the dorsal side of each pylon
about a third of the way down from the hul .
The four nacelles give it speed, but because it
lacks the embedded nacelle design of the                                             K’Vort
and B’rel , it has slightly weaker shields. The ship
mounts disruptors on the com and hul , around
the dorsal forward side of the main hul , along the
ventral side of the main hul , and aft; it also has a
forward torpedo launcher.
                    Although   categorized           as  a     normal
Destroyer, the                             Tro’Qa actually is almost as power-
ful as a Heavy Destroyer. For this reason, Klingon
com anders often assign it duties they would not
ordinarily give to a Destroyer. During the Domin-
ion War, the Federation alliance primarily used
Tro’Qas to patrol borders and fronts, and some-
times to dash across them into enemy territo y for
lightni g-fast raids.

Noteworthy vessels/service records/encounters:
I.K S. Tro’Qa                 , prot ype;                 I.K S. Dur’cha                , destroyed
in battle after crippling or destroying five Cardas-
sian vessels (2373);                           I.K S. Ightal                      , flagship of the
famed “Greyto h” Destroyer squadron during the
Domin War (2374-75);                                                I.K S. Kormag            , single-

 DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
 Fleet data:                      Designed as a joint project between
 House HIQal and Starfleet’s Advanced Starship
 Design Bureau, the                               VodleQ          -class Heavy Cruiser
 is one of the most technol gically sophisticated
 ships in the Klingon fleets. Using designs and
 systems developed during the planni g and con-
 struction of Starfleet’s                              Akira     -class Heavy Cruiser,
 coupled with the latest Klingon in ovations and
 adaptations, the ship synthesizes the best ele-
 ments of both to create a potent offensive and
 exploration platform.
                    The          VodleQ          relies on an un sually high
 degree of automation for a Klingon ship. Since
 House HIQal has never had the numbers of many
 other, more powerful, Great Houses, it has always
 sought to make up the difference with better
 weapons and tactics, and the                                          VodleQ          represents
 its latest step down that path. Carrying a much
 smaller crew and number of tro ps than most

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
Fleet data:                       As of 2376, the main fighting ship of
the Imperial Klingon Defense Force and the most
powerful Klingon Great Houses is the                                                     Vor’cha -
class Heavy Warship.                                      Vor’chas to k the lead in all
Klingon fleets during the Cardassian and Domin-
ion wars, as well as in many lesser encounters,
and undoubtedly wil conti ue to play a promi-
nent role in the years to come.
                    Unlike most 24th century Klingon designs,
which are influenced by the                                        B’rel , K’Vort       , and like
ships, the                     Vor’cha seems to hark back to the old
D7 cruiser and the                                    K’t’inga . Its body seems “thin”

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
Fleet data:                  The      Chut’Duj         is a vessel designed for
patrol of individual star systems. It contains weap-
ons for fending off pirates and other menaces, and
150 highly secure jail cells for the transport of
captured crim nals.
                  The    Chut’Duj              uses a variant        B’rel -class hul
and configuration. Although it has a warp core
for power generation, it lacks warp nacelles and
remains confined to the home system where it
was constructed (the space containi g the embed-
ded nacelles on the                              B’rel    contains cells on the
Chut’Duj              ). It replaces the disruptor canno s on
the forward tips of the wing pylons with arrays
built into the wings themselves, thus giving it
offensive coverage on the four main sides of the
ship.
