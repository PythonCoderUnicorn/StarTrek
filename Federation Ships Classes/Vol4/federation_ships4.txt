PATROL COMBATANTS

Two of the four vessels of the Entente class dreadnought have completed their outfitting and
are now on patrol duties. At this time, there are no plans for any additional dreadnought
construction, nor is Star Fleet actively looking at any new designs.
The new Defiant class of escort is currently entering full production with a final build rate of
five per year expected around 2380. At this time funding for twenty of these vessels has been
approved, though that number is expected to at least double, if not triple, in the years ahead
as these ships look to be an excellent value.

SHUTTLECARRIERS

At this time, no additional vessels of the Courageous class have been built and funding for the
second through fourth vessels has been formally cancelled before construction could begin. As
for Courageous herself, she is expected to remain close to Romulan space for the time being.

SPACE CONTROL SHIPS

Mistrusted and misunderstood since their inception in 2285, the Space Control ship’s future
remains with the three vessels of the Griffon class, which performed great service during the
Dominion War. However, Star Fleet has yet to convince the Federation Council to fund additional
vessels. Perhaps their heavy role in the rebuilding process might change this but, at this time, it is
expected that these three ships will remain the limit.

COMMAND SHIPS

The large Fleet actions against the Dominion reinforced the need for Star Fleet to begin
consideration of building more Command Cruisers. Though three vessels of the Sovereign-based
Whitehall class have been constructed, they are far too expensive for additional production. A
proposal has been drafted for a command ship based on the Intrepid class cruiser. It is currently
under review by the ASDB and SSDAC.

FLEET AUXILLIARY VESSELS

With the massive movement of supplies, materials, and personnel needed to begin the task
of rebuilding the Federation, a large number of auxiliary ships have been authorized for
construction. The MacPherson (TR 64381) class will be more than doubled in size from the current
forty ships to one hundred. In addition, the remaining vessels of the old Doppler and Dollond
classes have been recalled from mothballs and pressed into service on the closer runs, where
there slower speeds are not as much an issue.





SHIP CLASSIFICATIONS

Star Fleet ships and small craft are classified by type and by sequence within that type. The list of
classifications (by approval of the Federation Commissioner for Star Fleet) is issued periodically,
updating a system begun in 2208. Star Fleet’s current list, based on a format developed in 2290,
seeks to offer the most comprehensive definition of the types and missions undertaken by the
ships of the Star Fleet.

The following classifications are contained on the current list.

STAR FLEET HEADQUARTERS

Star Fleet Headquarters is located in and around the city of San Francisco on Earth. It also shares
space with Star Fleet Academy, located on the Presidio. The actual “Headquaters” building,
which houses the offices of the Admiralty, is located on Angel Island in San Francisco Bay and is
accessed by under-bay maglev and airtram. Other sections, such as Star Fleet Operations, are
located along the San Francisco waterfront and Marin County.

Star Fleet Headquarters is mostly located above ground, but the Star Fleet Operations Situation
Room is located deep underground for both protection and due to the sheer size of the facility.
The centerpiece of the facility is a hundred-meter diameter holo-projection globe showing the
entire volume of the Federation. From here, the Chief of Star Fleet Operations and their staff
monitor and administer all Star Fleet vessels and installations and their deployments.

The Headquarters facility suffered extensive damage during an attack by Breen forces in 2376
and is still being repaired and rebuilt. A new Operations Center was completed in early 2377 and
work in now progressing on a new Administrative Center. For the time being, most administrative
functions have been moved to the offices on Spacedock, while the Federation Council is using
space donated by the Office of the Presidency in Paris, France, Earth. Star Fleet Headquarters is
expected to be completely rebuilt by 2381.

exploratory suite. Eight Avenger class heavy frigates were also returned to the yards in 2285 and
converted to the Endurance class of explorers.

After peace was obtained with the Klingon and Romulan Empires, Exploration Command
began to exert more influence on the structure and composition of the Star Fleet. The Excelsior
class, first produced in response to the requirements of TacFleet, had morphed into a first-class
explorer replacing the Enterprise (II) class. The Constellation class of deep-space explorers was
developed and entered service around this time, as well.

As peace continued, Exploration Command began to enjoy budgets and priorities they had not
seen since the founding of the Star Fleet. The new Ambassador class of heavy cruiser, though
extremely powerful, was an explorer of the highest caliber. As the 2340’s arrived, plans were
drawn for an even more powerful and advanced explorer, the Galaxy class. The sheer scope of
the project absorbed huge amounts of the Star Fleet shipbuilding and material budget, but the
six ships produced were the marvels of their day. Exploration Command funding continued to
be strong, with the Sovereign, Nova, and Intrepid classes coming online between 2366-2371.

The declaration of hostilities between the Federation and the Dominion in 2372 severely
impacted Exploration Command. TacFleet was given direct control of all Miranda/Soyuz,
Galaxy/Galaxy (II), and Intrepid class cruisers, though the Sovereigns were kept under EC
control. In addition, Exploration Command facilities along the front-lines were absorbed into the
TacFleet command structure.

When the War ended in 2376, these ships and facilities were returned to the operational control
of Exploration Command, though TacFleet’s new mission means that some, such as the Galaxy
(II) class, can and are called upon to perform TacFleet missions.

Currently the emphasis is on the restoration of TacFleet, due to the massive losses it suffered
during the war. Construction of large explorers has been halted, but significant numbers of multi-
role vessels like the Sovereign and Intrepid classes have been funded as they can serve both
Exploration Command and TacFleet equally well.

the Star Fleet also serves to defend the Federation from foreign aggressors and TacFleet is the

budget were severely curtailed. By 2282 both TacFleet and the Rapid Deployment Force were
severely weakened, as what money was being spent was going to fund Exploration vessels
like the Tikopai and Endurance classes. With renewed Klingon activity in the mid-2280’s and an
apparent renewing of ties with the Romulans, Star Fleet funding in general was increased, with
more TacFleet-friendly classes entering service.

The signing of the Khitomer Accords in 2293, followed by the Treaty of Algernon in 2311, brought
an era of unrivaled peace and prosperity descended upon the Federation. Star Fleet began
to switch more and more of it’s shipbuilding budget to the construction of multi-role vessels
such as the Excelsior and Ambassador class and construction of TacFleet-specific ships waned.
Exploration Command began to re-assert itself and the balance of power shifted back to them
and away from TacFleet. As the decades rolled onwards, Exploration Command was able to
secure massive budgets to develop and procure the premiere classes of the Fleet, such as the
Galaxy, Intrepid, and Sovereign classes. However, hostilities with the Cardassian Union did allow
TacFleet to procure vessels more-tailored to their own needs, such as the Akira and Norway
classes. And the Borg incursion of 2367 shifted a significant portion of Star Fleet’s R&D budget to
TacFleet.

The Dominion War did for the TacFleet in the 2370’s much as the Four Year’s War did for them
in the 2240’s. Construction of Explorer-type vessels were halted as all available dockyard space

The Second Fleet patrols patrol and defends of the “southern” edge of the Federation in the Beta Quadrant. This includes the Gorn Hegemony and Tholian Assembly. Most of the Klingon Empire
also borders Second Fleet space. Due to the proximity to two less-than-friendly powers, the 49 ships from Exploration Command include a Galaxy (II) vessel, as well as a heavier-than average mix
of Ambassador, and Nebula class ships. TacFleet assets are mostly New Orleans and Norway classes, with a good mix of Akiras. Fleet Admiral Rosenberg is a well-regarded tactical and strategic
officer, and her appointment to the Second at the end of the Dominion War has been well-received by the Commanding Officers under her.

Fleet Strength: 204 Ships (70 TacFleet, 93 Exploration, 41 Auxiliary)
Fleet Commander: Fleet Admiral Dinky Rodriguez

The Fourth Fleet patrols the Rimward southwestern quadrant of the Federation. Due to the completely unexplored nature of this area, over half of the Fourth Fleet is composed of assets from
Exploration Command. Fleet Admiral Rodriguez has spent his entire career in Exploration Command, and the Fourth is one of only two Fleets currently under the command of an EC-branch officer
(the other being the Seventeenth). As for the TacFleet assets, they are primarily older New Orelans and Steamrunner ships.

Fleet Commander: Admiral Chris Wallace

The Fifth Fleet was originally tasked with the patrol, defense, and exploration of the underside of the Federation. Nexus Spacedock is located along ancient trading routes that linked areas of the
Federation, the Klingon Empire, and the Cardassian Union. As such, it was a major focal point of the Dominion War and the structure of the Fifth Fleet has been bolstered to ensure the safety of
commerce and transport in the area. With the dissolution of the Tenth Fleet, those assets were given to the Fifth, whose area of operation has been expanded to include the Cardassian Union
border and Breen space.

The Sixth Fleet patrols and explores the coreward section of the Federation and therefore the Fleet composition is close to even between TacFleet and Exploration Command vessels. The Sixth Fleet
also helps patrol and defend the Core Worlds with the Seventh, and the Fleet suffered heavy losses at the Battle of Wolf 359.

The Seventh Fleet is charged with the defense of the core worlds and some of the most powerful and advanced ships are assigned to this fleet, including the lead Sovereign class vessel and a
number of Nebula class ships, including the Lexington. The Fleet was savaged during the Dominion War and has received a number of new assets. The Seventh also explores coreward of Federation

The Twelfth Fleet is the first line of defense along the Romulan Neutral Zone. As such, it is heavily geared toward TacFleet assets, with three Olympus class dreadnoughts and one each of the Entente
class dreadnought and Griffon class battleship assigned to it, as well as a large number of Akira class cruisers and most of the Defiant class escorts. Exploration Command assets include the Galaxy
(II), Sovereign, and Intrepid classes. The Twelfth also patrols and defends the Core Worlds, with support from the Sixth Fleet. Fleet Admiral Alsera is a skilled tactician and her performance against
the Klingons during the short Klingon-Cardassian War earned her the respect of their warrior caste, who awarded her the honorary title of Thought Admiral.

As opposed to using the specialized prototype test crew (Cathedral Unit), the original test crew
for the Bright Star were selected from various personnel who were chosen for their particular
skills and experience aboard Galaxy and Nebula class starships. This was due to the significant
changes that had been incorporated into the Galaxy (II) class as well as Admiral Wallace’s
desire to train an R&D testing crew who would also serve as the ship’s Command Crew. It was
thus composed of some of Starfleet’s best officers in each discipline, and all are considered
experts in their respective fields. Of Bright Star’s original Command Crew, five were members
of the Federation Kempo Team for 2370, and they therefore chose “Team Kempo” as their
