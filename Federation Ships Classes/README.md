It has been over a year since the Dominion and their Breen and Cardassian Allies. Though the Federation Alliance proved victorious, the cost was staggering with Starfleet suffering almost 2,000 ships and over a million men lost.

When war between Federation and Cardassia in 2355 the _New Orleans_ class did not have photon torpedo launchers, causing the _Ambassador_ and _Steamrunner_ class ships to take the burden.

Jem'Hadar forces in the Gamma quadrant destroyed _Galaxy_ class cruiser USS Odyssey, this resulted in increase production of _Akira_ and _Intrepid_ class ships and 3 _Galaxy_ starships.

Before the Dominion War, the Federation had about 3,500 Class 1 starships, but at the signing of the Armistice, the number was 1,800. Starfleet is rapidly producing starships like the _Intrepid_ and _Norway_ classes, _Miranda_ and _Soyuz_ class ships took on serious damage from the Dominion War.
