by the Romulans.
Built for long-term scouting and exploration missions, the Deresus
quickly proved it could not just live up to, but surpass, the Prae-
tor’s expectations. Able to withstand the rigors of constant space
travel and the dangers posed by stellar anomalies and encounters
with hostile beings, the Deresus helped to expand the Empire’s
borders by leaps and bounds. It became so popular and renowned
that the Corps designed an almost identical, but larger, ship, the
Nir’at-class Heavy Scout. When the Empire needed a lighter,
shorter-range, but swifter scout ship in the late 2350s, the Deresus
again provided inspiration, contributing not only systems but the
experiences of many of its pilots, who designed the Tirethi-class
Scout.
Although now over fifty years old, the Deresus class continues
to serve on all the frontiers of the Empire. When the Corps of
Starship Engineers sets out to build a ship that can last, it doesn’t
do things by halves; many Deresus class ships continue to func-
tion superbly with only scheduled routine maintenance and occa-
sional minor system upgrades. During the Dominion War, many
Deresuses were enlisted to conduct reconnaissance against the
enemy. Now that victory has removed all obstacles to exploration
of the Gamma Quadrant, no doubt some Deresus-class ships will
journey through the wormhole to see what wonders lie on the
other side.
When originally designed, the Deresus had a standard matter/
antimatter warp drive. Pursuant to the Praetorian Edict of 2348
(known to Starfleet and other enemies and rivals of the Empire
as the “Expansion Directive”), the Exploration Command began
the process of class-wide engine upgrades. This work helped the
Corps of Starship Engineers refine its ideas for the artificial quan-
tum singularity drive, and when that technology became available
for installation aboard smaller ships, the Deresus again underwent
upgrades. As Romulan scientists continue to push back the fron-
tiers of scientific and technological development, no doubt the
Deresus will again see its systems improved so that it can continue
advancing the cause of D’era as swiftly and surely as possible.
Physically, the Deresus consists of a solid, rectangular main hull
with a small command hull (including a cockpit-like bridge) pro-
jecting from the forward end. The wing pylons project straight out
to the side, holding the warp nacelles at their ends. For times when

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES

FLEET DATA: Designed during the early 2360s using many of the
specifications developed by the D’deridex Design Group, the
D’valek-class Swift Warbird resembles that vessel in many respects,
though it is somewhat smaller. The principle differences are the
lack of a ventral superstructure arcing between the nacelles, and
the fact that the wing pylons sweep forward more sharply than on
the D’deridex.

Along with the T’varo class, the D’valek represents a new type of
ship: the Swift Warbird. Designed in part as a countermeasure
for the “Fast” subcategories of ships fielded by the United Fed-
eration of Planets during the past two decades, Swift Warbirds
are intended to retain much of the firepower of the heavier, less
maneuverable Warbirds, while exceeding them in speed and
agility. Despite its size, the D’valek is fast and nimble, able to
change course and maneuver more quickly than a D’deridex or
many other Warbirds. However, despite its higher Standard and
Sustainable warp speeds, it cannot maintain maximum warp as
long as the D’deridex, a situation Romulan engineers are laboring
to correct.

During the initial design period, the Star Navy envisioned the
D’valek as a long-range, heavily-armed support vessel for the enor-

Romulans down the Way of D’era. handedly destroyed an entire wing of Jem’Hadar Attack Fighters
during the Battle of the Hobileth Nebula (2375).
Romulan engineers designed the D’virin to have many external
and internal structural similarities with one of the Star Empire’s
earliest Warbirds, the Argus class of the first half of the 2200s
(sometimes also called the Te//us class). The teardrop-shaped cen-
tral body coupled with long, straight, downward-slanting nacelle
pylons, clearly betrays the Argus’s influence on the design. The
D’virin’s larger counterpart, the D’tavan-class Strike Frigate, looks
almost identical to it.
The Star Navy typically uses D’virins as long-range border patrol
craft, deep reconnaissance vessels, and rapid response ships. Their
large warp cores provide them with enough power to travel at high
warp velocities for longer than most Romulan ships, while also
allowing them to remain cloaked for extensive periods. Thus, in
wartime they often function as covert assault ships, sneaking far
behind enemy lines to strike vulnerable targets and then flee to
safety before the opposition can muster a response.
Because the D’virin’s large engines and other powerful systems
occupy so much space within the hull, the ship’s living quarters
and working spaces are among the smallest and least comfortable
in the Imperial fleets. However, the crewmembers shrug this off,
turning it into a point of pride rather than complaining about it. In
fact, some D’virin crews compete among themselves to see who
aboard the ship can tolerate the most deprivation and discom-
fort—a strange bonding ritual which captains permit because it
increases morale. D’virin crews enjoy an unspoken “bond of suf-
fering,” knowing they have shared a common experience other
naval personnel cannot understand. At military bars and outposts
across the Empire, they gather to drink ale and trade stories of
shipboard life, seeing who has the most outlandish tale of woe.
Some members of the High Tribunal have suggested that the time
has come to decommission the remaining D’virins and design a

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
FLEET DATA: One of the most successful Frigate designs in the
history of the Star Navy, the Melek’aan is a ship designed for two
specific types of missions: planetary/system defense, and plan-
etary invasion. As such, the ship lacks many “frills,” focusing on
systems that help it do its job: powerful disruptors; strong shields;
advanced medical facilities; and the ability to enter atmospheres
and make planettfall. The Melek’aan often doubles as a carrier,
ferrying loads of up to 180 troops (or more, in desperate straits) to
the battlefield.
The simplicity of the Melek’aan’s design mirrors the basic nature
of its role in the Star Navy’s fleet. The command hull, a wedge-
shaped structure, attaches directly to the forward dorsal side of a
roughly teardrop-shaped main hull somewhat reminiscent of the
old Argus class. The warp nacelles are held by two short pylons
each, one about two-thirds forward and one about two-third aft,
that project directly to port and starboard and dorsally. When the
ship makes planetfall, four landing struts emerge from the ventral
side of the ship, and disembarking troops exit via a descending
ramp.
NOTEWORTHY VESSELS/SERVICE RECORDS/ENCOUNTERS: (e/ek’aan,
prototype; Ger’ethan, landed troops on enemy-held planet during
Battle of Vendrath Prime despite fierce counterfire (2368); D’verrex,
participated in liberation of Benzar (2374).

main hull seems ordinary enough at first glance, but includes
many unusual superstructures. A diamond-shaped connecting
interhull forward bridges it and the command hull, which when
viewed from above has a teardrop-shaped profile, and when seen
from the side resembles the odd but fearsome beak of a gigantic
songbird. Oddest of all are the nacelle pylons. Instead of using tra-
ditional wing-style pylons, the designers used two spar-like pylons
per nacelle (one slanting sharply forward and down from the aft
end of the main hull, one projecting less sharply from the forward
end). Thanks to this, the ship vaguely suggests one of the kumataru
speed-sailing boats young Romulans race across wind-swept lakes
and seas.
But the Corps of Starship Engineers had more in mind than simply
creating a ship with a distinctive profile when they designed the
Meret. The pylons and other structures were created and shaped
to lighten the ship’s weight and improve its maneuverability, since
its primary mission profiles (long-range reconnaissance, search-
and-destroy missions, patrol and harassment) required a fast, agile

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
FLEET DATA: Although it’s approximately 20 years old as a class
by the end of the Dominion War, the Prelar-class Swift Cruiser
remains the most common ship of its type in the Star Navy. Thanks
to its excellent service record and a modular design that allows
rapid and easy upgrading of many key systems, it has not been
replaced by a newer model. Created to perform military recon-
naissance, military courier, and front-line combat duties, it has
excelled at its intended role. Many a Romulan admiral or sena-
tor has only made it safely to his destination thanks to the speed,
maneuverability, and firepower of a Prelar.
The Prelar consists of a roughly rectangular central main hull,
with two typical wing-shaped nacelle pylons projecting outward
and sharply downward. However, the nacelles themselves attach
almost directly to the main body of the ship dorsall, where the
wings meet the central structure; the pylons hold forward-mounted
disruptor cannons at their tips. The command hull connects to the
forward edge of the main hull via a short connecting interhull.
NOTEWORTHY VESSELS/SERVICE RECORDS/ENCOUNTERS: Pre/ar, pro-
totype; D’taxra, destroyed four Taurhai vessels during the Battle
of Tendasha (2357); Komra’shan, ferried Senators Krastus and Per-

SCIENCE SYSTEMS
Rating 2 (+1) [2 Power /round] 14 DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
Specialized Systems: None FLEET DATA: The first (and so far only) Swift Frigate type vessel
Laboratories: 6 2 in the Star Navy, the Thalan class is the product of one of the
most inventive and prolific starship designers of modern Romulus,
Dalgarius. In the early 2360s, the Star Navy expressed a desire
for a new ship intended for long-range patrols (particularly along

=~ 7h 2h Raine
1iPs TE ORE al Ar rer on

trade routes and frontiers) and rapid response missions of vari-
ous sorts. Dalgarius responded with a proposed design for a ship
much smaller than the High Tribunal had originally envisioned.
But because it included so many intriguing ideas (such as the inte-
gration of the artificial quantum singularity drive and biogenically
enhanced computers into a starship frame much smaller than that
of most ships possessing such systems), he was allowed to pro-
ceed. Although size considerations ultimately forced Dalgarius to
substitute a warp engine for an AQSD in the ship, the High Tribu-
nal allowed him to complete the design and produce the vessel.
The Thalan class incorporates some of the best propulsion system
components and power generation/transfer systems ever devised
for a Romulan vessel. If it has any weakness, it is that its weapons
are not quite as powerful as those most commanders prefer, and
that it lacks an aft weapon. In some cases, clever engineers have
found ways to retrofit larger energy weapons, and even plasma
torpedo launchers, into a Thalan, but most officers simply make
do with what the ship provides.
Physically, the Thalan resembles the Theta-class Swift Courier (to
which Dalgarius also contributed design ideas), with a few note-
worthy differences. First, it has three warp nacelles, with the third
mounted aft dorsal along the centerline of the main hull. Second,
it has two impulse engines, one aft ventral, and the other divided
in two and mounted beneath the wing pylons. Third, when viewed
from port or starboard, it lacks the slightly “curved” look of the
Theta, instead opting for straight lines and a sharper, less organic,
appearance.
NOTEWORTHY VESSELS/SERVICE RECORDS/ENCOUNTERS: = 7/ha/an, pro-
totype; Regareb, patrolled several key trade routes in the spinward
regions of the Empire (2371-73); Pellareus, rescued two dozen
hostages captured by pro-Vulcan terrorists and destroyed the ter-
rorists’ ship (2374); Ven’et, conducted patrol and reconnaissance
missions during the Dominion War (2374-75).

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
FLEET DATA: Designed as a cross between a scout and a cruiser,
the Thereus-class Bird of Prey combines the best features of both:
powerful engines so that it can fly at high impulse and warp
speeds; advanced power generation systems; sophisticated sen-
sors; and one of the best types of cloaking devices available in
the Star Empire. Like most Birds of Prey, its weapons are relatively
weak, but its crews master “decloak and fire” maneuvers to make
up for the lack.
The Thereus has a roughly teardrop-shaped main hull, similar
to that of the D’virin-class Incursion Frigate. The command hull,
with a downward-pointing “beak” shape like that of the D’deridex,
attaches almost seamlessly to the main hull’s forward side. The
nacelles are each held directly to port and starboard by two arch-
like nacelle pylons. As a result, when the ship is viewed from the
front—the only angle many of its victims ever see—it strongly
resembles a raptor striking to kill.
NOTEWORTHY VESSELS/SERVICE RECORDS/ENCOUNTERS: 1 7/hereus, pro-
totype; Ronax, ambushed and destroyed Taurhai scouting wing,
allowing the main Romulan fleet to surprise and quickly triumph
over the enemy at the Battle of the Blue Spiral Nebula (2371); Arg-
arathon, tracked down the vessel of the notorious pirate Maresk
the Savage and destroyed his flagship with a carefully-timed sneak
attack (2373); Debratha, participated in the raid on the Cardassian
fortress planet of Kharsadron, incapacitating several sensor sys-
tems so as to deprive the enemy of timely intelligence on Federa-
tion alliance fleet movements (2375).

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
FLEET DATA: The Star Navy, and many Romulan politicians, use the
Theta-class Swift Courier, an expanded and uprated long-range
warp shuttle, for transporting small groups of personnel—squads
of elite troops, a diplomatic delegation, a senatorial fact-finding
party, or the like. Though the basic accomodations are relatively
rough, best suited for soldiers and their ilk, for small parties the
ship’s crew can re-arrange its interior, providing more luxurious
private living facilities at the expense of two-bunk troop quarters.
As befits a ship that often has to travel into or through dangerous
areas to accomplish its missions, the Theta-class comes equipped
with impressive firepower for such a small ship: six Type Chareth
disrutors and two photon torpedo launchers. In fact, some ship
engineers and Theta crews have criticized this design decision,
noting that the ship rarely needs that much offensive power, and
that the disruptor arrays occupy space the ship could better use for
additional quarters, cargo transporters, and other such amenities.
The Star Navy so far refuses to order any class-wide design altera-
tions for the vessel. Rumor has it that some senators and other
high-ranking officials who frequently use Thetas have stripped out
two or three disruptors and replaced them with other systems.
NOTEWORTHY VESSELS/SERVICE RECORDS/ENCOUNTERS: 9 Jheta, proto-
type; Shargeles, personal transport of Admiral Chodeth during the
Third Taurhai Offensive (2365-66); Rilidam, lost due to unknown
causes (suspected to be Federation treachery) while on diplomatic
mission near Federation Neutral Zone (2366); Vastara, served as
testbed for proposed class-wide modifications and upgrades (2369-
71); Gheb’shaat, personal transport of Senator Vreenak, destroyed
by Dominion-Cardassian alliance while Vreenak carried evidence
of that entity’s plan to violate the non-aggression treaty and invade
the Star Empire, thus precipitating the Empire’s entry into the war
on the side of the Federation alliance (2374); T’lava, the Tribunal’s
primary transport during Dominion War (2374-75); S’narvak, cur-
rently assigned to ferry dignitaries and messengers between the
core worlds and various frontier outposts (2375-present); Surin,
currently assigned to Imperial Senate to transport senators to vari-
ous negotiations with the Taurhai (2375-present); V’te/ldan, cur-
rently used by Imperial diplomatic delegations conducting treaty
negotiations with the UFP (2375-present).

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES

FLEET DATA: Yet another of the many new ship classes which grew

out of the D’deridex Development Project, the T’korex-class War-

bird resembles a smaller version of the D’deridex, but with an

underhull which extends all the way to its command hull instead

of connecting via a boom. Observant personnel also point to the

slightly less tapered “point” on the ventral side of the command

hull, the alterations to the warp nacelles and the main hull where

it connects to them, and other minor differences when distin-

guishing between the two. Many Romulan commanders prefer the

T’korex to the D’deridex due to its greater maneuverability and

ease of internal customization.

Like its bigger brother, the T’korex sports an impressive array of

weaponry, ranging from a large forward disruptor cannon, to other

disruptors of slightly less power, to fore and aft plasma torpedo

launchers (the ship also carries singularity torpedoes). The ship

lacks a directly aft disruptor array, but does have an aft torpedo

launcher, as well as dorsal and ventral disruptor arrays that can

normally hit targets to aft of the ship.

Thanks to the arrangement of its cloaking device, EPS, and related

systems, the T’korex has an unusually efficient nullifier core.

Reduce the Difficulty for Tests to keep the core aligned with the

ship’s propulsion systems by one.

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
FLEET DATA: In the wake of the Praetorian Edict of 2348, which
commanded all Romulans to redouble their efforts to achieve
D’era, the Corps of Starship Engineers began working on designs
for exploration-oriented ships—a first for the Star Navy, which had
always stressed military needs and systems previously. One of the
earliest, and ultimately most successful, fruits of their labors was
the T’rasus-class Starbird, the first of the new “Starbird” explor-
atory vessels.
The design of the T’rasus drew heavily on the plans and specifi-
cations then being drafted by the D’deridex Development Proj-
ect. As a result, the T’rasus resembles the Heavy Warbird in many
respects. However, it has a shorter, thicker dorsal connecting
interhull and no ventral main hull body.
Created for long-term, deep-space exploration, survey, and con-
tact missions, the T’rasus has succeeded admirably at the goals
the Star Navy set for it. T’rasus crews have discovered more Class
M planets, and made first contact with more new species, than
the crews of almost all other types of ships combined. The T’rasus
spearheaded the efforts initiated by the various Exploration Edicts
of the 2360s and 2370s, and continues to expand the Romulan
sphere of knowledge, influence, and control in the Beta Quad-
rant. Thanks to its efforts, the Exploration Command has enjoyed

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
FLEET DATA: The Vadak-class Heavy Gunship blends a number of
typically Romulan starship design features into a pleasing whole.
The main hull is rectangular, with several small symmetrically-
placed superstructures along its length dorsally and ventrally. The
command hull, similar to those seen on the Theta-class Swift Cou-
rier and D’deridex-class Heavy Warbird, attaches directly to the
forward side of the main hull, though the aft edge is raised above
the main hull, not flush with it as on the Theta. The ship’s second-
ary impulse engine is mounted on the aft edge of the command
hull. The wing pylons look somewhat like those of the D’deridex,
but are smaller, and slightly swept back towards the aft of the
ship.
Designed to patrol and defend the borders of disputed systems
and fronts established by the Star Navy during time of war, the
Vadak is relatively slow when moving at warp speed, but fast and
agile at impulse so that it can react to enemy incursions swiftly. It
carries heavy shields and powerful weapons (mostly disruptors),
and some engineers have uprated their Vadaks with even greater
offensive capability (including an improved TA/T/TS).
The Vadak does not have the spartan interior one would expect
from a ship of its patently military nature—its designers believed
that serving aboard a fighting ship did not mean having to sacrifice
comfort. The corridors are roomy and well-lit, and the quarters
larger and more comfortable than on most Romulan ships of com-

the D’deridex class and its progeny with those of older models,
such as the D’virin and Meret classes. Its large command hull,
extending forward from the main body of the ship on a dorsal
“neck,” clearly shows the influence of the D’deridex, as do the
ship’s many weapons. On the other hand, its main hull (a large,
rectangular structure in one piece instead of the rounded, two-
part structure on the D’deridex), its straight, downward-thrusting
wing pylons, and its warp nacelles just as clearly derive from more
established designs.
The Corps of Starship Engineers did not combine these diverse
design elements on a whim; everything about the Vere/eus is
crafted to help it perform its missions as efficiently as possible.

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
FLEET DATA: The largest exploratory vessel designed to date by the
Star Navy, the Vidian-class Heavy Starbird resembles the much
smaller Neh’vor-class science vessel, except for a slightly different
command hull, wing pylons with slightly less forward sweep, no
exposed systems on the wing pylons, a broader central structure
for the main hull, and no half circle-shaped superstructure aft.
Able to remain in space for up to five years at a time, the Vidian is
a self-reliant vessel, crewed by loyal Romulan officers who don’t
mind the deprivation and separation from their loved ones if it
means furthering the cause of D’era. Venturing into the deeps of
space beyond the furthest Romulan outpost, they find new colony
worlds, new strategic assets, and rich economic resources for the
Empire to exploit.
NOTEWORTHY VESSELS/SERVICE RECORDS/ENCOUNTERS: Vidian, pro-
totype; T’re/t, found a Class L planet with what may be the richest
pergium deposits known to the Star Empire (2366); D’narex Tomair,
conducted comprehensive survey of the Vela Expanse and space
between the Romulan and Klingon Empires (2366-72); Requine,
was attacked by and destroyed warning beacon and patrol ship of
unknown species in a region coreward of Romulan space, but has
proceeded onward with its mission of exploration (2375).

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
FLEET DATA: One of the newest warbirds in the Romulan fleet,
the V’tir incorporates design principles different from those of the
D’deridex class and related ships. Instead of using the Argus class
and its successors as the basis for the design, the Star Navy’s engi-
neers chose instead to look to that line of ships deriving from the
D-7 class Battle Cruisers obtained from the Klingons in the late
2360s. While Romulan ship designers had used aesthetics and
system arrangements deriving from the Klingon vessels in later
starships, they were not nearly as common as Argus-descended
ships. Chief Engineer Praddus, the man in charge of the V’tir
Design Project, decided to take the path less chosen and try to
develop an innovative and powerful ship that wouldn’t look like
the D’deridex’s younger cousin.
The jury remains out on whether he succeeded. In the eyes of
many, the V’tir is an ungainly-looking cross between a D-7 and

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES eee eee i ee
FLEET DATA: The most powerful and versatile vessel fielded by the of their ships, those names remain unknown.
Taurhai Unity, the “Star Dragon” (a Romulan term; the Taurhai
designation is unknown) represents the pinnacle of Taurhai space
travel technology. It consists of a 300 meter-long wedge-shaped
command hull, which also includes the main engineering sec-
tion, and 24 50 meter-long segments. Thanks to Taurhai structural
integrity fields, gravity induction units, and other technologies, the
ship can “coil” and “flex” at the joints of the segments, thus allow-
ing it to perform some bizarre, but highly effective, maneuvers in
combat. (Consider the Star Dragon to be Size 5 for purposes of
calculating the amount of benefits it can receive from maneuvers,
and the Difficulty of performing those maneuvers; see Spacedock,
pages 101-03.) The ship’s gravimetric deflectors are located to
port and starboard of the ventral side of the command hull.
Furthermore, a Star Dragon’s crew can separate the ship, divid-
ing it into the command hull and up to twelve “sub-ships” of two
segments each (see Detachable Segments, page ?¢?). Normally this
is only done when the ship as a whole has been badly damaged
(or is otherwise stranded), but occasionally Taurhai commanders
have used this feature to surprise and defeat an enemy.
Virtually any other Alpha or Beta Quadrant species would find a
Star Dragon to be a treasure trove of advanced, sophisticated tech-
nology. Taurhai transporters, tractor beams, and the like put those
of the Star Empire or the Federation to shame, and many other
Taurhai inventions could be incorporated in other species’s sys-
tems to their general improvement. Unfortunately for the Romu-
lans, the auto-destruct systems on Star Dragons are very efficient,
leaving little more than dust behind. Taurhai crews willingly sac-
rifice their own lives to prevent their technology from falling into

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES
FLEET DATA: The Firedrake (a Romulan designation) is, in essence,
a miniature version of the Star Dragon, with many of the same (or
slightly inferior) systems. It features a 125 meter-long command
hull, and eight 25 meter-long separable segments. (Consider the
Firedrake to be Size 4 for purposes of calculating the amount of
benefits it can receive from maneuvers, and the Difficulty of per-
forming those maneuvers; see Spacedock, pages 101-03.)
Compared to the Star Dragon, which frequently undertakes
exploratory missions, the Unity regards the Firedrake as a more
purely military vessel. When not assigned to a specific wartime
fleet, Firedrakes usually patrol disputed borders, conduct raids
and skirmishes against threats, defend shipping against pirates,
and so forth.

DESCRIPTION AND NOTES

FLEET DATA: The primary military and exploration ship of the
M’rok (see accompanying sidebar), the Wa’h’kr’aa’ta-class Cruiser
was first encountered by the Romulan ship Visen in 2364—which
was also first contact between the two species. Although the initial
confrontation nearly turned into a fight between the two vessels
over the rights to an unclaimed system, the two species found a
way to work out their differences and begin more peaceful con-

o o R Nas OF THE PLANET M’RokTA’RA (“Home of the People”), the
7 M’rok are a tall, often spindly-looking species descended
M’ROK TEMPLATE from an arachnid-like animal. Their most distinctive physical
features include their four black eyes (grouped two by two on
Artrieutes their head), which grant them superb vision; their purplish skin
Fitness 2 [5] (the color actually results from a very short layer of fur-like hair
Vitality +1 all over their bodies); and their long, three-fingered arms (which
Teoh make them excellent climbers).
Reaction +1 The M’rok are best known outside their home region of space
Intellect 2 [5] for the duelling elements of their culture. All M’rok know how
Perception +1 to use the ta’tak, a hook-like bladed knife, and often many other
Presence 2 [5] distinctive weapons as well. Any M’rok who takes any degree
Empathy -] of offense at any action or statement of another M’rok can chal-
Psi 0 [5] lenge him to a duel, then and there, and killing someone in a duel
does not count as a crime (though it may start a blood feud with
SKILLS the deceased's family). Since “offense” is entirely subjective, the
Athletics (Climbing) 2 (3) M’rok have developed elaborate customs of courtesy and tact-
Culture (M’rok) 2 (3) fulness. Interactions between M’rok, or with a M’rok, often take
History (M’rok) 1 (2) many times as long as interactions between other species, since
Language the M’rok have such a roundabout, overly polite way of saying
M’rok 2 and doing everything.
Marld Krowtelen Gilt om Although regarded as hot-tempered and bloodthirsty because
of their duelling, in truth the M’rok are as sensitive and cultur-
Typicat ADVANTAGE ally diverse as most other species. Their art, particularly paint-
Night Vision +2 ing, is highly regarded, since their eyesight allows them to see
Peripheral Vision +1 and use subtleties of color and shading that most species cannot.
Their religions are often highly philosophical, complex, and open
(though a few have spawned close-minded fanatics, as well).
Following their initial contact with the Romulans in 2364, and
their eventual alliance with the Star Empire in 2366, the M’rok
have developed strong ties to the Romulans. They have adopted
many items of Romulan culture, and Romulan aesthetics have
become something of a “fad” over the past decade. Nevertheless,
the M’rok remain a distinctive and fascinating species in their
own right.

hesitate to beef them up with extra power, use suicidal tactics like

close passes and ramming runs, and so forth. They like nothing

better than to catch some Romulan ships unawares, ambush them,

and destroy them.

The Unasha consists of two structures. The first and largest is a

wedge- or arrowhead-shaped main hull. Attached to the aft dorsal

side of that is the second, a dome-like (or sometimes rectangular)

superstructure, the command hull. The forward dorsal edge of the

command hull typically features a small structure that contains

the bridge, but in some variants the bridge is moved further aft (to

the center of the dome) or embedded within the command hull for

greater protection. Two pylons reminiscent of those on a Galaxy-

class Explorer project port and starboard from the aft end of the

main hull to hold the nacelles.
